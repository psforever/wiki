Several expeditions were sent through the wormhole to colonize Auraxis, and soon after the colonists discovered the remains of an ancient alien race, the Vanu. This allowed for the rapid colonization of the ten continents of Auraxis, as well as development of new technologies, most importantly - rebirthing technology. Rebirthing technology allowed humans to deconstruct and reconstruct their bodies, but more importantly, workers who had lost their lives could be brought back to life using rebirthing technology.</p> <p>However, the colony was soon cut off as the wormhole collapsed, and dissension brewed within the ranks within the Republic. A loss of faith in the Terran Republic caused the colonists to split into three very distinct factions and a war over technology began.</p>"},{"location":"PlanetSide/#terran-republic","title":"Terran Republic","text":"<p>The Terran Republic consists of colonists who remained loyal to the Republic, and is a conservative, authoritarian collectivist nation with the goal of re-establishing contact with the homeworld and re-unite the warring factions. Thier leadership comes in the form of a public oligarchy known as the Overwatch, composed of various representive officials and thier ministries, who regulate their parts of society with their own expertise and the collective will create favorable outcomes. The Republic feels that authority is the bastion that protects humanity. They feel that in a free society, with no Big Brother figure, misery and suffering will be quickly visited to all. The Republic regards the Vanu technology as dangerous and volatile force which threatens the stability of their order, and only use it in warfare begrudingly. The Republic view of the future is one of peace through their benevolent rule, and a reunited colony through the reopening of the wormhole. The Republic stands by the view that the Vanu were extinct by their meddling with orders of power and fear that using this technology again will drive humanity into a similar fate, causing as much damage to reality along the way. The Republic relies on the brute strength of their armies and fleets, and the application of their superior firepower.</p>"},{"location":"PlanetSide/#new-conglomerate","title":"New Conglomerate","text":"<p>The New Conglomerate is a militant seperatist faction composed of anarchists, liberals, and libertarians determined to break and remain free from the domineering Republic.

As a group of rebels, their leadership lies within the Revolutionary Command, a visible group of military experts who guide the liberation efforts as a whole. They feel that any type of control is oppression, and would rather be a miserable free man than a contented slave. They view Vanu technology as a tool of control, and that the Sovereignty are simply technochratic tyrants, would-be dictators under the banner of science, and just as bad as the Republic, if not worse. Their ideal view of the future is one of freedom and self-government, where each man flourishes in his own way as he sees fit.

They see the Republic as an outmoded restriction on the continued development of alien technology and cotinued development of the species through synthesis of man and machine. They also see the Conglomerate as a savage band of thugs, possessed by a mob rule and refuse to see that technology is the future of humanity. The ideal Sovereignty future is one of scientific purity and perfection, and believe that the Vanu race used the power of their advanced sciences to transcend their corporeal limitations and the mundane world, ascending to a superior state of being, and, ultimately, a higher plane of existance. They envision humanity following a similar path, first through the enhancement of humans through science, and, ultimately, the replacement of humans by machines. The Sovereignty is the most reliant on alien technology, and often use it to overcome their shortcomings through the superiority of their engineering, utilizing mind bending physics and high-energy arrays to defend themselves.</p>"},{"location":"PlanetSide/#analysis","title":"Analysis","text":"<p>Within the game, there has been much discussion over which factions are inherently good or evil. Some claim the Republic to be the empire that was intended to be the villains of the game, due to the theoretical similarity to Fascism, although it can be argued that neither the Republic nor Fascism are inherently bad, as they are only doing what they feel is right on the whole, which is protecting humanity from its own incompetence. These same people also tend to contest that the New Conglomerate are the heroes of the game, however, this is also contestable. The New Conglomerate is rabidly anti-everyone and see no room for beliefs other than their own, and also because of the fact that, living in a Liberal Democracy, one might be pre-inclined to see liberty as the cheif concern. Most people agree that the Sovereignty are at least partial villains, due to their embrace of technologies today we say as immoral, and due to their notion of replacing humans with machines. However, this may also be contested as our understanding of such technology such as cloning and genetic engineering stem from the latest science fiction film. Ultimately, it seems as though the developers of PlanetSide were attempting to make each of the factions good in someways, but none of them have are morally better than the other, and all of them have some sort of moral bankruptcy within their backstories.

Also, these underground chambers were not for habitation, but were merely baffles and routing structures for these energies. However, due to an information leak within the Sovereignty scientists, the other two empires also know how to activate the Geowarps and how to take advantage of the information inside of the caverns.</p> <p>Because of this, the three empires are using these new areas to produce new technologies for war, but because all three empires have access to the Geowarps, no empire has a technological advantage.

To report a bug, please visit the official forums or use the /bug command in game. Below is a list of currently known bugs and ways to work around them.`</p> <ul> <li>BFR Bug</li> <li>Description: When gunning for a BFR     you can only aim up and down, when the BFR walks you stay in one place and     not with the driver.</li> <li>Workaround: Immediately bail out of the BFR and then go back in.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Door Bug</li> <li>Description: Facility doors sometimes appear closed even though they are in     fact open and enemy fire can go through. This bug most commonly occurs at     the Back Door.</li> <li>Workaround: Go up to the door and open it manually. This is only a temporary     fix and the bug can occur again at any time.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Friendly-Manned Ancient Sentry Turret Bug</li> <li>Description: Sometimes a member of your own empire that is manning an     Ancient Sentry Turret will have their     name in enemy colors as seen with the     Enhanced Targeting implant. You get     grief for shooting the seemingly     enemy-held turret even if the friendly is in your own     platoon.</li> <li>Workaround: None. You can ask the occupant to get out and back in which will     likely fix the problem. If you find friendlies shooting at you constantly,     get out and back in yourself!</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Scorpion Bug</li> <li>Description: Sometimes the secondary bomblets fired from the     Scorpion do not emerge from the primary explosion,     basically making the weapon useless.</li> <li>Workaround: Sometimes dropping the weapon on the ground then picking it up     works. Other times you have to respawn to fix the problem.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Missile Lock-on Bug</li> <li>Description: Sometimes lock-on weapons (Striker,     Starfire, Sparrow, and     Wasp) only lock or maintain lock when the crosshair     is directly over the target, making it almost impossible to maintain a lock     on your target.</li> <li>Workaround: Usually the only way to fix the problem is to quit and open     PlanetSide again. Respawning does not fix the problem in most cases.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Enhanced Targeting Bug</li> <li>Description: The Enhanced Targeting implant will     sometimes show an enemy vehicle or     Wall Turret as having almost no health left, while in     fact they are at full health. This sometimes happens when the vehicle is     damaged, goes out of draw distance to repair, and then draws again at a     later time. You will see the health it had the last time you saw the     vehicle, and do not see that it was repaired.</li> <li>Workaround: Dealing any damage to the enemy vehicle or Turret will cause its     proper health to display.</li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"archive/Launchpad_Chat/","title":"Launchpad Chat","text":"<p>THIS INFORMATION IS OUTDATED, THE LAUNCHPAD CHAT WAS REMOVED LONG AGO.</p> <p>The Planetside Launchpad has a built in chat system with 7 chat rooms.</p> <ul> <li>Emerald</li> <li>Werner</li> <li>Markov</li> <li>New Conglomerate</li> <li>Vanu Sovereignty</li> <li>Terran Republic</li> <li>General</li> </ul> <p>Clearly General chat is the one that most people go to upon opening Chat.

This organization vowed to take down high officials not only in the Terran Republic but within the other empires as well. Did they consider themselves the true fourth empire? No. They considered themselves the new rulers of the Auraxian System overall and plotted to destroy all three empires.</p> <p>High officials in the Terran Republic discovered information about this organization after a failed assassination attempt. The assassin was quickly slain after vital information had been beaten out of him. The other members of the organization got word that their secret had been discovered so they immediately went into hiding. Some remained hidden within the Terran Republic, while others scattered into the New Conglomerate and the Vanu Sovereignty empires. They continue to remain in contact with each other. In order to remain out of sight, they changed their tactics and decided to cloak their way to victory quietly.</p> <p>Each empire has offered a merit reward to anyone who \"infiltrates\" the organization and assassinates the assassinators.

KAAOS (Killing As An Organized Sport) had been with PlanetSide since day one.</p> <p>Led by it's long-time leader Hedron, KAAOS had made it's mark by their patented \"KAAOS Drops\". This drop was marked by the large group of AirCav (Reavers and/or Mosquitos) that flew over a target, and dropped all at once. Once landed, and the door is breached, they surged to their target, emphasizing KAAOS' underlying principle of speed.</p> <p>In more recent history, KAAOS had also made its mark in the hearts of all BFR pilots. Numbers permitting, the sargeants of KAAOS would often lead the aircav fleet on Reaver runs to attack BFRs attacking a base. A leader was called, and that leader went ahead with the reaver mob behind them. The leader would then call a target BFR, and every pilot would then unload their reaver's payload into that BFR. About 96% of the BFRs targetted by this method were destroyed on the first run and any second runs promised the BFRs demise.</p> <p>On October 8th, 2005, KAAOS publically announced it's retirement from the game.

They quickly were snatched up by a Tactical Outfit, the Band of Bros. Both Soldiers excelled in the game, and in making leadership decisions, leading to their quick promotion to officer rank. One of those Soldiers excelled so much that the outfit leader, one NemisisOrion, Gave the outfit to him when he left the game. That Soldier was Soulkeeper. Since most of the experienced players left with NemisisOrion, Soulkeeper had to build the outfit back up. After a couple of months of hard work doing that rebuild, NemisisOrion came back, and wanted control of the outfit again, which Soulkeeper relinquished peacefully. NemisisOrion used a diffrent leadership style than Soulkeeper, which many new members of the outfit who had never served under NemisisOrion did not like at all. They convinced Soulkeeper to drop from Band of Bros and lead them in a new Outfit, named Soul_Strike. At first there was some bad blood between the newer and older Outfits, but over the years things have smoothed out. Soul_Strike has also gone through periods of turmoil, usually when the Outfit Leader must be gone for extended periods of time.

The PSForever now has a domain and forums. This is great first step to getting this project off of the ground. PSForever goal is to reproduce PlanetSide 1 server functionality in order to preserve its one-of-a-kind gameplay, forever. Many of us have fond memories of playing PS with friends and it's quite sad to see PS in its current state: frozen, overrun with hackers, and with no steady population. It's strange how a game can evoke such nostalgia and emotion, but there it is. Everyone has a PlanetSide story to tell.</p> <p>PlanetSide 2 was supposed to be the \"NextGen\" version of PlanetSide 1, but its clunky gameplay mechanics just don't compare to PS1. While PS2 looks better, PS1's gameplay is truly unique. It's not Yet-Another-Run-and-Gun game. It has real strategy, progression, and teamwork. This isn't to say PS1 was the \"best game ever\"...It wasn't. But it was a unique, quirky, and overall great time. This is what we remember about PS1. PS1 was revolutionary for it's time as a new genre and with a single persistent world where decisions and base captures really do matter.</p> <p>The current state of the project is focused on capturing existing PlanetSide functionality through the use of a packet logger. In the event of a server outage, any capture files, screenshots, databases, etc. will be crucial in order to reproduce vanilla PS (minus the terrible parts). This along with static analysis of the PS binaries will allow us to make a PlanetSide private server, using a process similar to TrinityCore, MaNGOS, EVEmu, ShadowbaneEmu, SWGEmu, and many more inspiring projects.</p> <p>Even if you aren't a die hard PlanetSide fan, that's okay. This project is for everyone interested in helping preserve a little slice of history from the digital garbage bin. Current there is only one developer working on this project, i.e. me. My schedule is quite busy beyond this project, but with regular updates and your support, this project will come to fruition.</p> <p>Check back regularly for new project updates, tool releases, and ideas. In the mean time, register an account to get involved. Also, start capturing packets in order to record PlanetSide gameplay! If you have already started capturing, hold on to those captures. I'll be making a form to submit them when I get the chance.</p> <p>Original Post</p>"},{"location":"archive/psforever/PlanetSide_Shutdown/","title":"PlanetSide Shutdown","text":"<p>There are a few things that need to be looked in to before the game shuts down. While packet captures are great, how things are arranged in memory is really crucial for reverse engineering.</p> <p>1.

If you submitted, thank you so much for your time. If PlanetSide's servers went down today, we'd be in good shape.</p> <p>In other good news, I have just open sourced the GameLauncher and GameLogger tools to GitHub.

Also anyone who is enterprising enough can contribute their own changes to the tools (please do). Check out the open source projects now!

I'm spending a lot of time getting the libraries and base code right as I know it's going to be heavily used. After my work, I now have working packet encryption, decryption, and encryption setup: no small feat. I spent way more time in 2014 than I'd like to admit digging through the horrible ugly crypto + netcode. It paid off though and I now have a clean working crypto library.</p> <p>But the crypto packets are literally just the beginning. There are over 250 more packet types that need reverse engineering.</p> <p>Some technical tangents on the language and architecture:</p> <ul> <li>The programming language I chose (Scala) for the server is amazing and   expressive. It makes C++ look like assembly language, yet is still very fast.   This is good for me and you as I now have to spend a whole lot less time   working on the low-level things and I can get straight in to developing</li> <li>Scala has one of the most amazing libraries known as Akka. Akka gives you   something called the \"actor model\" in your code. This model allows for dead   simple concurrency (many things happening at once), which means the server   will be fast. A problem threaded servers have is scheduling work. Each actor   can be scheduled individually which will let the server run hot</li> <li>With the actor model, full server crashes are going to be non-existent.   Essentially each player session will be given one Actor as a base, so if   something crashes, it's likely just to kill that user's session, not the   entire server's</li> </ul> <p>What this means for you guys is that this server is going to be awesome and modern.

Yeah not as much as I was hoping for either. I've been quite slammed this spring with work and I just haven't been able to devote as many cycles as I would like. I do need to make a point to keep you guys up to date regardless though. Otherwise I figure most of you will probably scurry off to another corner of the internet out of boredom.</p> <p>I'm currently doing server development on my Linux machine which is great, but obviously not ideal because PlanetSide is windows only. I've been able to get away with this for a while as PlanetSide has great Wine support. The best apart about having chosen Scala is that I don't have to change any code over from Linux to Windows due to it being JVM based. One thing I do have to change which is slowing me down right now is my crypto library is in C++, which is platform specific. It's working for Linux only and I would need to port it over.

Busy times on my end, but I got to spend some time hacking around with the PlanetSide client tonight.</p> <p>Friday Night Hacking</p> <p>Core combat isn't enabled on the server side, but the PlanetSide client doesn't care! I messed around with map loading state changes and I was able to fake load some cave maps, while being networked on a real continent. To other people it would look quite strange as I would be flying around ignoring any collision detection. Somethings I learned about the game from tonight:</p> <ul> <li>All physics and collision detection is clientside. If this were to be removed,   then walls, doors, or the floor wouldn't stop you</li> <li>Water damage is server-side</li> <li>Nearly all of the interesting GM commands are patched out of the client. Like   the code has literally been compiled out. This is quite sad as I suspect the   server probably has more than a fair share of strange bugs regarding these   commands.</li> <li>There are multiple embedded command processors within planetside that allows   for high level actions to to take place. For example, the command for loading   a map is 'psc_loadmap'. This goes for the creation of all game objects as   well. Logging the calls to these command processors should help figure out how   the game is running</li> <li>The /paintball command is locked behind a special bit on the client, but once   enabled it allows the creation of floating text anywhere in the world. It's   simply a debug tool and nothing else.</li> <li>The cave maps are located in the PlanetSide/expansion1 folder and are prefixed   as ugd. Example: ugd01</li> <li>When loading in to a cave map while actually running on a bigger continent,   the cave map is always towards the bottom left corner of the overworld map.   This is where PlanetSide's (0, 0) coordinate lies.</li> <li>There is a /spectator command in the client, but unfortunately it is patched   out</li> </ul> <p>Here are some screenshots: Image Image Image Image Image Image Image</p> <p>Website News My site is now fully backed up with a disaster recovery plan in place. I can now sleep easy. PSF will never die, NCGauss. Sorry for all of the horrible spam that has cropped up recently. There is a dedicated and passionate group of people who want this project to burn. We should expect more things like this in the future. Active couter-measures are in place and I keep quite a close eye on server health.</p> <p>Login Server Coding Not much has gotten done in this area unfortunately. This is quite important, but the momentum has been lost. Spring break is coming up for me soon and I hope to get some serious coding in then. At least what I have done so far is open source. I need all of the help I can get in this area. Code doesn't write itself.</p> <p>Packet Captures We are nearly at 10 million total packets captured!

I was a total newbie 3 weeks ago and most of the time I still suck at the game (my kill vs. death ratio is about 1 : 3, which is very very bad). Yet I am having fun, and that is what counts. This guide is supposed to provide some basic skills and tactics that hopefully makes Planetside enjoyable to you from the very first day of play. In this guide, I only suggest a few options that are open to you as a new player. In no way, this is a complete or comprehensive guide.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Astrala%27s_Guide_to_Planetside/#starting-planetside-for-the-first-time","title":"Starting Planetside for the first time","text":"<p>If you are completely new to Planetside, then there is a few things to note. Don't do the \"training\" option. This is severely broken because development continued on the game's features but the training option was never kept up to date. For example it will tell you to get a vehicle from the vehicle terminal, but it won't let you. This is frustrating and makes you think the game is broken, when in fact only training functionality is broken.</p> <p>So if you press \"Play\", you will be required to pick a game server. Pick the one with a low ping. For Europeans this will be Werner, for East Coast users this is likely Emerald and so on. Then create a character. Pick one of the three empires for your new character. You can create multiple characters if you like, but each character starts out with next to no abilities. So you might want to focus on developing a single character first.</p> <p>Improving yourself and your abilities in Planetside is based on battle Experience Points (BEP). BEP is awarded for kills that you or your squad members achieve. Also you get BEP for taking over an enemy base. Your Battle Rank (BR) increases the more BEP you collect.</p> <p>With each Battle Rank you gain one certification point to invest into your abilities like piloting certain vehicles or using particular weapons. Also with Battle Rank 6, 12 and 18 you can add Implants to yourself that also provide new abilities. The highest BR to achieve is 23, but it will take a long time to get there (I have just reached BR 12 after 3 weeks). The higher your BR, the slower you will advance to higher levels. On the flipside, this means that initially you will advance quickly. Yay!</p> <p>Initially you will be awarded battle experience points for every new thing you try for the first time. Be it wielding weapons, driving vehicles or visiting locations or using terminals. If you are completely new to Planetside, you will only have BR 1 and no experience and no certifications. You will find yourself starting at your Empire's Sanctuary. This is a protected zone that does not allow presence of enemy forces. In the Sanctuary you will find a building marked \"Training\".</p> <p>So go to the shooting range in the training facility and visit the equipment terminal. Press the \"G\" (use) key when looking at the equipment terminal. This opens your inventory as well as the equip window. In the equip window you can obtain armor, weapons and support items. Double click on a weapon and drag it into one of your holsters. You can also add any item into your backpack space, however then it is not immediately available for wielding. When you have a weapon in a holster, press the key corresponding to that holster (typically 1, 2 or 3). Now go to the virtual shooting range. It provides many targets to try your weapons on. Many weapons have multiple firing modes. Switch firing modes with the right mouse button. The active firing mode is indicated by the yellow dot next to the weapon. Some weapons can use two types of ammunition. Most rifles take standard bullets as well as armor piercing bullets (golden). Ammunition types are swapped with the \"X\" key.</p> <p>You will get BEP for a weapon if you have used ALL its firing modes at least once. Try ALL available weapons. Also get different types of armor. See how they provide different number of holsters and different space for equipment? The \"infiltration suit\" is a special type of armor. It can be activated with the \"B\" key and makes you nearly invisible. However you can only wield one pistol or one tool at a time.</p> <p>If you have tried all the weapons and armors, you should leave the virtual shooting range with the teleporter beam in the middle of the room. Then go to the vehicle range. It simulates a virtual terrain to try different vehicles on. Go to the vehicle pad and press \"G\". Pick any vehicle you like. The vehicle will materalize and you will be in the driver's seat. The vehicle will roll of the pad and then you get full control. To get out of a vehicle, press \"G\". To get into a gunner's seat, walk around the vehicle until you stand near a yellow circle on the ground indicating a gun. Press the \"G\" key again and you will enter the gunner's seat. Again, try all the gunner's seats on all the vehicles and use all the firing modes on each gun. That will give you a lot of experience points.</p> <p>If you are done with weapons and vehicle training you should have advanced to Battle Rank 4 at least.</p> <p>By visiting all worlds through the warpgates and also by using all kinds of terminals, you get some more BEP which should allow you to get to BR5 without having shot at a single enemy.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Astrala%27s_Guide_to_Planetside/#planning-your-career-path","title":"Planning your career path","text":"<p>Initially you had 4 certification points to spend on your skills (certs).

It is guaranteed to get you some good kills however you are very vulnerable when faced with infantry and vehicles. The Anti-Vehicle MAX (AV MAX) and Anti-Infantry (AI MAX) are more expensive certs costing 3 CP. The disadvantage of the MAX suits is that the primary weapon is fixed and you cannot wield any other weapon or any other tool.

HART shuttles leave every 5 minutes from the Shuttle building in the sanctuary. You can then pick your drop target from the map. Pick a map with those yellow flashing stars on them. These indicate hot zone where fighting occured recently. You might want to land close to a friendly base so you can stock up on vehicles, aircraft or weapons.</p> <p>By using the \"instant action\" option, available when you press the ESC key, you rematerialize in a friendly facility close to a random hot spot on any world.

After 3 weeks, I still havent memorized every single base layout. There are Amp Stations, Bio Labs, Tech Plants, Dropship Centers, and Interlink Facilities, each having a different layouts and multiple stories. So I often finding myself wandering through the corridors, not ending up where I want to. The map only offers limited orientation because it only shows the level you are currently on.</p> <p>Typically you will spawn in \"spawn tubes.\" If you don't like the location you spawned at, you can walk right back into the spawn tube and press \"G\" to rematerialize at a location you choose. You can either pick your empire's sactuary, or one of two or three locations indicated on the map in flashing circles - the nearest facility, the nearest tower, and the nearest AMS. One special place for materializing are so called Advanced Mobile Stations (AMS). These are vehicles that typically get driven close to an enemy base or tower and deployed. Friendly soldiers can spawn at that location and equip with basic armor and weaponry (no MAX armor though and no vehicles or aircraft!). And the best thing is: The AMSes have a shield around them that make them invisible to the enemy's eyes and radar. So an AMS acts as a trojan horse that can be driven close to the enemy's location and hopefully offers a staging ground for a successful invasion by foot.</p> <p>Tip: If you want to select a particular base or AMS for respawning, use a Matrixing panel to permanently add this base to the selection available on your map for respawning. Matrixing panels are small rectangular panels in the wall inside a base or at an AMS.</p> <p>As a final option, you can take the warpgates from the Sactuary to other worlds. The broadcast warpgate will offer the largest number of choices to go to. In contrast to \"Instant action\" or HART, you can use warpgates in your vehicles. This is probably best if you plan to attack in large numbers with heavy machinery.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Astrala%27s_Guide_to_Planetside/#basic-game-objectives","title":"Basic Game Objectives","text":"<ul> <li>Do not shoot friendly troops.

However it is very agile and can be operated by a single person. While driving you usually need to look forward, otherwise you might run into obstacles. This is a bad thing if you need to flee from a pursuing vehicle because it will be difficult to gun backwards while driving forward!</p> <p>So there is a few guidelines for operating a Lightning successfully:</p> <ul> <li>Learn to operate the gun effectively against moving targets. You need to lead   and you also need to account for the arcing projectile. This can be difficult.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Use the chain gun against infantry targets and aircraft (switch firing modes)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Don't ever drive into large groups of enemy forces. If they all target you,   you stand have ZERO chance. If you don't die instantly, you will usually die   running away because gunning while fleeing is difficult (see above)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Don't take on fights with Battleframes (BFRs). They are more powerful and will   typically destroy you.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Avoid charging heavy tanks like Prowlers or Vanguards, unless they are already   damaged or you are engaging the enemy in a group.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Try operating the Lightning in packs for increased efficiency.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>You stand a larger chance if your shields are fully charged. To charge   shields, stay inside a friendly base's sphere of influence for a while (your   empire needs to possess a linked Amp station on the continent in order to   charge vehicle shields).</li> </ul> <ul> <li>When damaged, seek cover in a safe distance from the fighting hotspot, leave   the vehicle and use your Advanced Nano Dispenser (glue gun) to fix it. Watch   out for enemy cloakers or aircraft while fixing your vehicle. If anything   shoots at you, get back into the vehicle immediately. Your vehicle can also be   repaired at a friendly base at a rearm/repair terminal.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The lightning can also work as mobile artillery because of its arcing   projectiles. You can shell the courtyard of an enemy facility easily if you   place the tank on a good location outside (e.g. a hill). Just watch for enemy   aircraft!</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Infantry are usually easy targets, unless you hit a group that is equipped   with anti-vehicular weapons. You can also run over infantry targets to injure   or kill them.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>When you get hit, try to figure out what hits you and from where. Decide what   is the largest threat to you and whether it is better to attack or reatreat.   Spitfire turrets can be a great danger, especially if there is more than one   firing at you. Sometimes running them over works best.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Wall turrets at bases are extremely powerful. Attack these from behind cover.   It requires about 10 shells to take one out or more than 300 chaingun rounds!</li> </ul> <ul> <li>MINES! Watch out for mines on roads, bridges and near enemy installations. Two   mines can bring a lightning from perfect state to nearly destroyed (\"lost   control of the vehicle\"). Three mines will destroy it on the spot. After hit   by mines, stop, go reverse the same way you came and fix your vehicle.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Fire on mines using 3-4 shells or dozens of chaingun rounds on the exact   location of an enemy mine will destroy them. However due to limited   close-attack range it is difficult to target mines from a Lightning.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>You can make use of the trunk space of your Lightning for storing useful gear   (not just tank shells and chaingun rounds). You can store your Advanced Nano   Dispenser in it if you dont want to carry it in your backpacks.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Astrala%27s_Guide_to_Planetside/#infiltration-tactics","title":"Infiltration Tactics","text":"<p>So you have become cloaker and want to be effective in what you are doing?</p> <p>Basics</p> <ul> <li>Never ever forget to enable your cloak (B key) when you suspect enemies   nearby. To check this, you can wield a weapon, which should then appear   transparent. The little armor icon on the HUD will also appear differently   when cloaked. Last but not least you can use the third person view (T key) to   verify your cloak is active.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Cloakers should enable the Sensor Shield implant when moving near turrets and   motion sensors. The implant takes a while to initialize after respawning. Be   patient.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>If your stamina runs low and you need Sensor Shield, rest for a while to   regain stamina.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Cloakers have limited space in their backpack and only one pistol holster. So   they can only wield a pistol, a grenade or a remote electronics kit at a time.   Carefully plan what you are taking with you. Don't forget the REK if you want   to hack a base or tower.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Cloakers can use a melee attack against infantry (key: 5, wields a knife).   Using the \"melee booster\" implant the knife can be lethal on the first strike   at the expense of some of your stamina points.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Be aware that the enemy can use the dark light implant to see you. Be aware   that some enemies can have graphics details settings or graphics drivers   tweaked so they can more easily spot you. It is safer to approach an enemy   from behind.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Laying mines or setting up turrets requires the combat engineering certificate   on top of the engineering certificate (5 CP total). This ability can also be   used as a non-cloaker, but it is not recommended when operating in the midst   of an enemy presence.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Be aware that your location is given away if you operate weapons or tools,   plant mines/boomers or other deployables.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Certain actions, like firing a weapon or using the REK temporarily negate   sensor shield and makes enemy turrets fire at you. Don't use the REK on doors   that have an enemy turret and a motion detector installed nearby.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>You will also be visible when hit by enemy or friendly fire. Stay out of the   line of fire.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Try to place boomers at spots often frequented by enemy soldiers or vehicles.   Stay in visual range and operate the detonator in the moment an enemy passes   over your boomer. You can stack multiple boomers to achieve a more powerful   explosion! Boomers can also be placed on walls or overhead in doorframes.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>You can use an unarmed ATV vehicle while cloaked. That is the \"Wraith\".   Requires the cheap (1 CP) ATV cert.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>You can easily infiltrate and hack a base when cloaked. You can also attack an   enemy facility's generator. However plan for a counterattack after the enemy   notices your presence. Coordinate with friendly troops to make sure the hacked   command center gets defended.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>You can also throw grenades (frag, plasma or jammers) at the enemy when   cloaked. This briefly affects your invisibility, so its best to attack the   enemy from behind.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Cloakers can eject out of an aircraft (e.g. a Mosquito which is hard to spot   on radar for the enemy) and drop right on their intended target.</li> </ul> <p>Advanced Knowledge</p> <ul> <li>If your enemy has the Audio Amplifier Implant enabled, you need to use sensor   shield AND crouch walk (C key) to remain invisible from his radar.   Unfortunately there is no way to tell who has this implant and who has not.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>You can hack enemy vehicles and take ownership. This requires the Advanced   Hacking certificate (5 CP in total). Nothing is more annoying to the enemy   than taking enemy heavy armor and using their own heavy weapons against them.   Be aware that in some vehicles you can only be pilot or gunner but never both   at the same time and you require the corresponding cert do pilot it.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Mines can be used to trigger boomers if you are not around. Mines can only be   laid outdoors. Stack a mine close to a boomer and it will set of the boomer as   well. This has a devastating effect!</li> </ul> <ul> <li>If the detonator of a boomer dematerializes, the boomer also dematerializes   and vice versa. That means if you get killed while there were detonators in   your inventory, the boomers also go away! To avoid this problem, put the   detonators into your locker or a vehicle trunk (but   make sure the vehicle stays around long enough). You can also drop the   detonators, at the risk of someone else (enemies) picking them up.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Astrala%27s_Guide_to_Planetside/#burster-max-tactics","title":"Burster MAX Tactics","text":"<ul> <li>NOTE: This is a guide for using The TR Burster MAX, NOT the VS Starfire or   NC Sparrow MAX <p>I did this tonight with great success. Within a few hours I racked up 32000 experience points and 29 kills. The tactics described here may not be honorable, but it surely results in lots of kills.</p> <ul> <li>Camp an enemy air tower or base that is likely used as a repair base for   Mosquitos and Reavers or as staging area for aerial assaults (e.g. drops from   a Galaxy transport). Climb a hill nearby, try to stay exposed as little as   possible and wait for targets.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Anchor your AA MAX before shooting (B key). When anchored you have a limited   turning radius. Make sure the anchor radius you selected suits your needs.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Mossies or Reavers hovering over an air tower's rearm pad are easy targets.   Just pump a round of 20-25 projectiles towards the pad. Most of the time the   target will be destroyed before the pilot knows what hit him.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Reload after shooting a magazine only partially (R key). It is frustrating if   a target manages to escape because the auto-reload kicked in after a few fired   rounds.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>For moving targets, lead ahead. The further away the target and the faster it   is moving, the greater the lead has to be.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Watch for revenge missions. Sometimes a downed pilot will return in a Mossie,   eject right next to you and try to finish you off with his assault weapons.   You have little chance in that case. You can either run and hide or try to   duel it out. AA shells do not cause great damage to infantry, beware.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>In other cases, the downed pilots will alert teammates in heavy armor to hunt   you down. Try to disappear behind the mountain and pop up someplace else   before they find you.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Hitting heavy targets like a Galaxy results in lots of BEP, especially if the   Galaxy was loaded with passengers. If you happen to camp a staging point for a   Galaxy drop, you can totally screw their intended mission and rack up lots of   BEP.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Your BEP rewards can be increased by as much as 50% if you play on a continent   where two other factions duel it out and your population is much smaller than   the other factions. I got a funny chat message once, saying \"lol. you have no   business on this continent, TR!\" after I downed an enemy pilot on such a   continent.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>You can move much faster by engaging the run mode (Q key), however your   weapons are down while you run. BEWARE: You cannot come to a sudden stop, it   will take a few seconds to slow down. (S key). So if you run towards a ledge,   make sure you stop well ahead or you will overshoot the ledge and fall down.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>SECRET TRICK: hold the S key while at the same time hitting the strafe keys (A   or D) and you will immediately stop moving forward (you will move sidewards   though). You can use this to dodge bullets or rockets that have been fired at   you with a lead. You can also use this to avoid overshooting the position you   are running to.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Astrala%27s_Guide_to_Planetside/#credits","title":"Credits","text":"<p>Written by:</p> <p>(Astrala, TR on Werner.

Each certification costs a certain amount of points. Characters start with seven certification points. New characters already have these certification points spent, so it is recommended that you go to a Certification Terminal in your empire\u2019s Sanctuary or Bio Laboratory facilities.</p> <p>In PlanetSide with current populations, vehicle certifications usefulness are diminished since most fights take place indoors where vehicles have virtually zero impact. I will list exceptions to this rule later.</p> <p>How to repair your armor and heal yourself The certifications of Engineering and Medical are convenient for repairing your armor and healing yourself respectively. However, newer characters may not always have access to these certifications. There are very valid workarounds, although they typically Fortunately, most of the combat in PlanetSide with current populations revolve around battling near Equipment Terminals.</p> <p>To repair your armor without Engineering (regular armor, not MAX or Infiltration Suit): Go to an Equipment Terminal Choose a loadout of a different armor type you are currently wearing Choose the loadout of the armor type you were wearing</p> <p><code>(Hotkey process: G \u2192 # \u2192 G \u2192 #)</code></p> <p>This will repair your armor to full. Be warned, if you change loadouts to the armor type you were wearing, the armor will not be healed.</p> <p>To repair your armor while in a MAX If you are in a MAX suit, you can repair your armor by going to a Medical Terminal. It may be more convenient in the heat of battle to have a player repair you. You can inform nearby players that you need repairs by using a voice macro. (Keys: V-N-R).</p> <ul> <li> <ul> <li>One very useful tip/trick, if you standing directly behind someone at point     blank range, they can repair you. This is extremely useful if that player is     third person camping. It is important to note that not all players will know     about this trick.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>To heal yourself without Medical/Medical Applicator Not having Medical is less convenient than not having Engineering. The reason for this is Medkits, one of the few pieces of equipment that everyone has access to, regardless of their certifications. Medkits can be used to heal yourself for 25 health every 5 seconds. They are useful and in the thick of battle because they essentially increase your effective health -- they are instant cast and don\u2019t require any weapon change. **For this reason, I recommend switching the Medkit hotkey to a button that is easy to hit, other than the default of F1. Personally, I use Right Click so I don\u2019t have to move my keyboard hand (responsible for movement in fights) to press it.</p> <p>Medkits can be useful out of combat when you don\u2019t have Medical or don\u2019t have a Medical Applicator. Typical Reinforced Exosuit loadouts contain 2-4 Medkits. If you don\u2019t have Medical, and/or access to many certifications such as Anti-Vehicular, you can often times make room for more. For instance, I have a specific loadout that contains 8 Medkits in Reinforced Exosuit. Typical Agile Exosuit loadouts contain 1-3 Medkits, depending whether or not you take a Decimator or not, and if you take extra hand grenades.</p> <p>In downtime between fighting, make your way to an equipment terminal. One of the main advantages of Medical is that you can heal yourself with a lot more inventory efficiency than with Medkits, and that you don\u2019t waste Medkits for downtime instead of fighting. However, since most fights take place near Equipment Terminals in current day PlanetSide, this advantage is mostly negated. Take as many opportunities as possible in downtime to return to Equipment Terminals and replenish your loadout with Medkits, as well as using the armor swap trick to repair your armor. These two methods will make the lack of Engineering and Medical certifications much less painful.</p> <p>Combat</p> <p><code>There are a few important aspects to combat in PlanetSide that are important to learn about as a beginner.</code></p> <p>Movement/Strafing</p> <p><code>Strafing is an important part of infantry combat. In this game, strafe movement is quicker compared to other games in the FPS genre, so you can help mitigate damage through good movement. Strafing side to side (A-D-A-D) for approximately one second in each direction is a sweet spot that can create a rubber-banding or \u2018warping\u2019 effect that can throw off an enemy\u2019s aim. Sometimes you\u2019ll want to take a longer strafe and throw the warping strafe in to throw off an enemy. The more unpredictable your movement (while simultaneously integrating the warping strafe) the better.</code></p> <p>Agile ExoSuit moves and strafes faster, so this effect can be more prominent when using it. Additionally, you can more easily execute circle strafing or flanking maneuvers. However, it requires some pretty good skill and game sense to do so.</p> <p>Third Person/Camping</p> <p><code>Since there is a third person mode that allows you to see around corners (albeit not aim), many players will camp corners to gain advantages in combat, waiting for unsuspecting troops to push forward. While it\u2019s not always a guaranteed kill, it benefits the defender greatly in a lot of cases (particularly 1v1 situations). If you are uncertain if an enemy is around a corner, throw a hand grenade at it to determine if an enemy is there or not. If the cone of fire appears, then you hit something.</code></p> <p>Boomers (Spawned through Combat Engineering\u2019s ACE Device) are very deadly remote controlled mines used primarily indoors by third person campers to get an instant kill on enemy infantry or do heavy damage to MAX units. You can use third person to check corners in a hostile area before you proceed. If you spot a boomer (a gold, triangle shaped mine), you can throw a Jammer grenade around the corner to destroy it. Boomers are often a newbie trap, but using this technique will highly mitigate their threat.</p> <p>Radar Your minimap in game displays the location of friendly and enemy players, MAXs, and vehicles. Friendly are green -- enemy are red. Radar viruses can influence this sometimes, but they are typically rare. It\u2019s important to keep an eye on red dots and bracket looking blips while indoors. If your base has Interlink benefits, you can see enemies if they are moving (running) while not crouched or walking. You can also get a similar effect from using the Audio Amplification Implant, which should typically be your first or second Implant pickup. This is an important part of the game that many people utilize to their advantage. It is important you do so as well.</p> <p>New Character Quick List: Go to the Certification Terminal in the HART Building Access the Certification Terminal using the \u201cG\u201d Key Forget certifications: ATV and Harasser Get to the fight using Instant Action (/instantaction, or Escape &gt; Instant Action) OR board the HART in the HART Building.

A REK is needed to hack doors and Control Consoles. Additionally, it is needed to hack Equipment Terminals with Advanced Hacking. If you don\u2019t have one, you can find yourself stuck outside an enemy base or unable to hack an enemy Control Console!</p> <p>If you are a new character who lacks the Anti-Vehicular certification, it is recommended that you bring some Gold Ammo (Armor Piercing) boxes into your loadout to help deal with MAX Units.</p> <p>Newer players with less certifications will probably be more interested in the alternative loadouts requiring less certifications.</p> <ul> <li> <ul> <li>NOTE: These are the Terran Republic versions of loadouts.

When you do end up dying, the spawn screen will appear. This consists of usually two or three respawn points. This would be the closest Tower, Facility, and Advanced Mobile Station (AMS) if available. You have to wait a certain amount of time based on your number of deaths before respawning. This ranges anywhere between one second and one minute. When the timer ends, you materialize in a respawn tube. If you don\u2019t like where you have spawned or wish to respawn somewhere else, go into the Respawn Tube and press \u201cG\u201d to deconstruct your avatar. On the AMS, the respawn tube is located at the back of the vehicle.</p> <p>Scattered throughout the facilities are Matrixing Panels. By hitting \u201cG\u201d you bind yourself at that facility. An AMS will have a Matrix Panel as well, and is located on the very front of the vehicle. Binding at a facility will let you respawn at that facility, even if it isn\u2019t the closest. You can only be bound to one facility and one AMS at a time.</p> <p>Advanced Mobile Station (AMS) The AMS is a vehicle that serves as a mobile spawn point. It also features a Matrixing Panel at the front and two Equipment Terminals on either side. If you wish to deconstruct yourself, you can do so by going to the rear end of the AMS. The AMS can be acquired from a Vehicle Terminal by certing Ground Support.</p> <ul> <li> <ul> <li>NOTE: When populations are extremely low, it is sometimes considered     unethical to camp or destroy spawns, particularly an AMS. The reason for     this is that it kills the fight for a while, leading to meaningless     downtime. This isn\u2019t a problem when the game has enough players to work     correctly from a design perspective. However, when populations are extremely     low, sometimes it\u2019s considered bad etiquette to do so. Use your best     judgment!</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Bombing_Guide_by_Quovatis/","title":"Bombing Guide by Quovatis","text":"<p>Bombing can be very rewarding.

The bomber seat can drop two types of bombs: Anti-Infantry cluster bombs and Anti-Armor tank buster bombs.

These bombs do almost double the damage to armor as their liberator counterparts, but fall more slowly and are released more slowly. This means it's more difficult to get enough bombs on a heavily armored target to kill it before you pass over. The Vulture has a higher top speed than the Liberator and has an afterburner.

Each has their advantages and disadvantages as will be discussed.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Bombing_Guide_by_Quovatis/#low-altitude-bombing","title":"Low Altitude Bombing","text":"<p>I generally favor this tactic 90% of the time. I find it gets more kills than high altitude most of the time and your survival rate is higher as long as there is cover nearby.</p> <p>For low altitude bombing you want to fly as low as possible to the ground to avoid being seen by the enemy. You want to fly just high enough as to not set off any mines on the ground. Approach your target from the flanks or rear. You only want to take enemy fire on your exit and not your entrance. As you approach, gain enough height so that the bombing icon is illuminated and level out. After you pass the target (and hopefully destroyed it), dive back down the previous altitude. Get to know each base terrain and plan your flight path accordingly. Flying behind terrain and trees will break lock-on weapons. Find a safe place to land, repair, and repeat the process.</p> <p>If you are doing low-altitude bombing, you generally do NOT need to take a tailgunner with you. The tailgunner will have little to shoot at and even if an enemy aircraft starts shooting at you, you will be so low to the ground that the tailgunner will not be able to shoot up high enough to hit the target. Know where friendly anti-air MAXes are and retreat to them if you are under air attack.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Bombing_Guide_by_Quovatis/#high-altitude-bombing","title":"High Altitude Bombing","text":"<p>I personally rarely use this tactic, but in some cases it works better than low-altitude. You will generally get less kills from higher altitude as the enemy will see the bombs on their radar for many seconds before impact and have plenty of time to run away. However, high altitude exposes you to enemy fire for less periods of time generally as they don't always see or notice you up there until you start dropping bombs. I use this tactic when the enemy is clumped up on a bridge as they have nowhere to run except to drown. I also use it if the enemy base is at a low altitude and I'm fighting flak weapons (Wall Turrets and TR Burster MAXes. You're fairly safe from flak at high altitude unless you fly very predictably and the enemy has great skill.</p> <p>Again you will want to approach from the side or rear so that the enemy isn't looking in your direction. Climb to maximum altitude ALWAYS. Never bomb from a medium altitude as you are easily visible and have no place to run or hide. I sometimes find it handy to place a personal waypoint on the target as it's difficult to see the ground from high altitude. After your bomber drops its bombs, turn sharply in some direction. This will make it very difficult for flak to hit you. Change directions randomly every 5 seconds or so if you're taking heavy flak fire and go to the ground to repair. Never fly in a straight line away from flak weapons. If you took little or no damage, feel free to turn around and make another pass.</p> <p>I highly recommend taking a tailgunner along for high altitude runs. You will almost always attract enemy aircraft. Always fly at flight ceiling so that the enemy cannot get above your tailgunner's line of fire. If you are in the middle of nowhere and there is no threat from the ground, STOP the aircraft, point the nose down as far as you can, and keep the tail pointed towards the enemy aircraft by looking at your minimap. This will generally close the distance between you and the enemy, making your tailgunner land more shots and hopefully destroy it quicker. If you don't do this, the aircraft will just stay at maximum distance and take pot-shots at you all day until you die. Of course, if you know you are near friendly anti-air units, you always have the option of running to them as well.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Bombing_Guide_by_Quovatis/#lining-up-targets","title":"Lining up Targets","text":"<p>If you don't put the target under you bombardier's sights, you obviously won't get any kills. This is your most important job. The most helpful keymap you can make it to make the \"reset controls\" option (default alt-r) to something easily accessible. I have it mapped to a mouse button. If you want to make 100% sure you are level and your bombardier can drop bombs, use this button liberally, as it will auto-level your bomber. This is especially useful when you are coming out of a steep turn or ascent.</p> <p>Take note of the black vertical line in the pilot seat. This is the bombing line. The bottom end of the line is what the bombardier's sites will pass over. You can affect this line by strafing left and right. I find strafing very useful. As you pass over a clump of infantry, strafe left and right a little bit. This will spread your bombs out perpendicular to your travel direction, giving your bomber much more area to saturate in bombs and making it less likely that someone can dodge your pass.</p> <p>Generally, you want to avoid trying to bomb moving vehicles. But you can always try. Make sure to lead them enough. You will have to lead them much more than you think, and your bombardier needs to understand how to do this too for a successful kill.</p> <p>You should be glancing at your mini-map every 2-3 seconds. If you fly directly over an AMS, it will show on the radar, alerting you to make another pass. The radar will also allow you to line targets up better and know where enemy aircraft are.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Bombing_Guide_by_Quovatis/#standard-targets","title":"Standard Targets","text":"<p>Your bread and butter targets are generally ridges and base walls. Ridges are routinely saturated with players if it overlooks a base, providing cover for snipers and anti-vehicular users, and even armor. This can yield many kills while always providing decent cover to run to on the other side of the ridge.</p> <p>The other great target are walls of bases. On the attack, the wall facing the tower is the most populated if your empire owns the tower. Line up the wall running down its length and lets the bombs fly on unsuspecting snipers.</p> <p>Wall Turrets can be the most difficult of targets to destroy. Many times your bombardier will overshoot the target, making the bombs land past the target on the ground. To minimize this risk, it's best to line up wall turrets so that you pass directly over the stairs leading up to them (or the place where you might get in for tower turrets). Placing bombs right on the stairs instead of trying to put them directly on the turret will maximize your chances of damaging or killing it. Make sure you tell your bomber this information as well.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Bombing_Guide_by_Quovatis/#avoiding-enemy-fire","title":"Avoiding Enemy Fire","text":"<p>I've already talked about how to avoid flak fire. Never fly in a straight line when taking flak fire and try to find some cover to break the line of sight.</p> <p>Against the Sparrow MAX, you need to fly a little differently. If you find Sparrow missiles following you, find terrain to hide behind immediately. Even a small hole will do sometimes. Dip down and STOP in the hole briefly. Wait until all the missiles have hit the ground around you, then continue. If you hadn't stopped, you might have avoided one or two missiles, but the rest would still have followed and hit you.</p> <p>Against a Striker or Starfire you can either find a tree or terrain to break the lock, or simply fly out of its effective range (250m for the striker, 350m for the Starfire). If you are flying directly away from them at the same altitude, be sure to turn slightly as you reach the maximum effective range, as the missiles will still follow their previous path and may hit you if you don't change direction slightly.</p> <p>Against a Wasp and you are flying low, fly through trees as much as possible to break the lock. Flying inside an Aegis Shield Generator will also break the lock, but you will likely give away its position, so use wisely. At altitude, you have less options. Fly towards friendly anti-air units. If you have a tailgunner, your best bet is to stop the aircraft and point the tail to the wasp, as described earlier.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Bombing_Guide_by_Quovatis/#liberator-or-vulture","title":"Liberator or Vulture?","text":"<p>When you first get your shinny new Vulture, you will be tempted to use it a lot. The sad truth is the Vulture is inferior to the Liberator in almost every way, even though it is supposed to be an upgrade. While the vulture bombs do more damage, they have a smaller splash radius, fall slower, and release much slower. It also takes twice as long to reload a clip.</p> <p>I use the Liberator in almost all cases, however there are circumstances in which the Vulture is actually the better choice. I use the vulture in situations where anti-air cover is high and I want to fly low. With the vulture, you can come in, drop some bombs, then afterburn away to safety. You won't get as many kills with the Vulture, but you will live more, so there is a trade-off that you will have to balance.</p> <p>The tactics with the Vulture is almost identical to that of the Liberator. However, you generally want to avoid flying high-altitude missions with the Vulture as it takes forever for the bombs to reach the ground. The biggest difference is that you need to slow down over a target to allow enough bombs to be dropped to kill it. You can then quickly accelerate by afterburning away to safety. Due to the small splash radius, you must really fly directly over the target. A Vulture bomb will only kill a soldier wearing Rexo armor if it lands within 1-2 meters of him.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Bombing_Guide_by_Quovatis/#which-bombs-to-use","title":"Which Bombs to Use","text":"<p>This is obviously something the bombardier selects, but if he or she is not picking the right bombs for the situation, you need to inform him. The Vulture can only drop AV bombs, so there's no problem there. The Liberator, however, can drop cluster bombs or tank buster bombs. The cluster bombs spread out into 9 bomblets in a 3x3 grid pattern, while the tank buster bombs simply drop to the ground with one big explosion. Cluster bombs do less damage, but do the same full damage over a large area. The tank buster bombs do more damage, but the damage falls off over a relatively short distance away from the impact.</p> <p>Use cluster bombs on large groups of infantry. It will take two bombs to kill most infantry. Works best if you strafe as discussed before to spread out the damage. The main use of cluster bombs are on BFRs. Yes it sounds strange, but cluster bombs actually do more damage to a BFR if its shields are up than a tank buster bomb does. It also has a higher probability of damaging critical systems. However, if the BFR has no shields, it's best to use tank buster bombs.</p> <p>Tank buster bombs should be used the majority of the time. It kills infantry in one hit if reasonably close and does great damage to vehicles. If you don't get anything else out of this guide, please USE TANK BUSTER BOMBS ON MAX UNITS! It takes two tank buster bombs to kill a MAX while taking 8 cluster bombs. Nothing annoys me more than my bomber dropping cluster bombs on an anti-air MAX only for it to live and shoot us down after we pass. These bombs should also be used in proximity to doors as the splash damage will kill enemies inside the door while cluster bombs will not. Also use tank buster bombs in heavily forested areas as cluster bombs will sometimes explode at tree top level, rendering them useless. Of course, tank buster bombs should be used on all forms of vehicles, except BFRs, as discussed earlier.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Bombing_Guide_by_Quovatis/#bombardier-information","title":"Bombardier Information","text":"<p>Drop bombs on the enemy right? Well it's not always that simple. Dropping all 10 bombs on the first target you see and then having to reload when you pass over a cluster of 15 troops will make you and the pilot mad. Always look as far forward as possible to spot highly concentrated targets and save the majority of your bombs for that if you don't think you can reload in time. And as I've already mentioned, use tank buster bombs on MAXes!</p> <p>Not every bombardier realizes that you can aim your bombs a little. By moving your mouse up and down you can change the location of the crosshair and that's where the bombs will land. In level flight at full throttle, you should be able to land all 10 bombs on a single point.</p> <p>When bombing targets at the top of a hill, aim a little on the downslope closest to you to ensure you will hit it. It's embarrassing to watch all 10 bombs fly over the vanguard you were targeting and go down the mountain, missing completely.

Though the mechanics of a base capture are simple, there's a lot of different ways you can do it.</p>   The Goal: Hack the CC   <p>When you are attacking a base the ultimate goal will be to hack the Control Console of the facility and secure the control console. You must keep control of the CC until either the 15 minute capture timer runs, or in the case of an LLU base, the LLU is delivered.</p> <p>It takes 20 seconds for an advanced hacker to control a CC, so you must be sure that the CC is never insecure for more than 20 seconds. Furthermore, when you are attempting to stop an enemy from taking your base, remember that once it gets down to that 20 second mark, they will get the base, so it's time to change from defense to offense at that base.</p>   Securing the hack   <p>Ultimately, control of a base comes down to controlling spawn points. If you can spawn at a base and the enemy cannot, you will win most of the time. It is possible for well coordinated forces to retake a CC without having a nearby spawn point but it is far more difficult to do so.</p> <p>There are three types of spawn points to consider in this situation:</p> <ol> <li>AMS</li> <li>Towers</li> <li>Base spawn tubes</li> </ol>   Base Spawn Tubes   <p>Generally speaking, the closer a spawn is to the CC, the more dangerous it is going to be for you. The base spawns, being inside the base, are obviously the greatest threat to a successful base capture.</p> <p>To shut down the base spawns you can either destroy the individual tubes or destroy the generator. A tube can be destroyed with one boomer, three decimators, or a number of other combinations of weapons. Armor piercing and AV weapons are going to be best suited to destroying tubes.</p> <p>The tubes, though easily destroyed, are also easily repaired. An engineer need only repair one tube half way to permit forces to spawn at the base. So another tactic is to destroy the generator.</p> <p>A destroyed generator is more difficult to recover from because it not only shuts down the spawn but also all equipment terminals. It also takes more effort to repair a damaged generator. The side-effect of taking down a gen though is that, as the attacker, you also lose the ability to make use of the equipment terminals at the base.</p> <p>Destroying generators should usually be avoided except as a last resort. You should never destroy the generator of a base that is your first link into a continent. This will leave you with no ability to spawn vehicles on the continent.</p>   Towers   <p>Towers, though usually a good distance from the base, are dangerous because of two factors:</p> <ol> <li>MAX units can be obtained at them</li> <li>Towers are indestructible</li> </ol>   AMS's   <p>Though AMS's can be destroyed, unlike a tower, it requires that somebody be able to get outdoors with the proper gear to do it.

They provide a spawn location near an enemy facility, much like an AMS. A tower, though in a fixed location at the edge of a facilites SOI, has several advantages over an AMS. First off, it has it's own SOI, meaning enemy's can't drop certain CE devices just outside the door. Also, since it's a structure, it can't be destroyed, and protects infantry from OSs and vehicles. One of it's biggest advantages, however, is that it allows access to MAX suits, a feature that the AMS is lacking.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/DragonJTS/#defending","title":"Defending","text":"<p>First and foremost, CE is key. Place boomers on the inside door, one each, and an alarm near the CC. Heavily mine the outside. Spits and alarms aren\u2019t too useful outside, as vehicles will probably show up early, and then easily destroy them, without taking much damage. Mines, however, will wreak havoc on them. A very deadly combo is a combination of Disruptor Mines and AV. The mines make it so vehicles can't fire their weapons, leaving them open to a salvo of AV rockets. MAXs should set up just inside the door, on the stairs towards the CC. If the people using them have DL, they should activate it. Once the enemy is inside, push hard from the spawn room, and head either to the CC, or keep pushing the enemy outside. If you can bring in vehicles from an outside source, do so, or else enemy vehicles will seal you in. Once they reach the spawn room, try your best to kill them, calling for some CC defence to help (keeping in mind it's probably also under siege). Repair the spawn tubes and terminals as necessary. Also keep an eye out for airdrops on the roof. SA will be really useful in shoving back anyone who comes through the main floor. Just sit on the lower and upper landings, aim at the ground floor, and fire (after making sure it\u2019s clear of friendlies). Standard weaponry is all that\u2019s needed for taking out air droppers. However, despite this, once the tower has troops inside, it\u2019s near impossible to beat them back without outside support. in a heavily forested area, a TRAP may be able to bottleneck people, but in an open space the high influence radius makes it little more then a target. Cerberus turrets placed on the roof/ground may help prevent mossies campers, but will do little to stop droppers and ground forces. Also keep an eye out for phantasm, who can easily drop half a squad onto your roof with no warning. Shadow turrets, however, can make a heavily defended roof appear an easy target, perfect for ambushes on droppers.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/DragonJTS/#attacking","title":"Attacking","text":"<p>Attacking is quite a bit easier. First, bring in vehicles to take out spits and enemy troops, as well as other vehicles. Once you have the outside secured, then set up a vehicle perimeter, and start firing inside once the doors open (until your own side starts going through, of course). If you have the means, drop on top, and attack the CC, forcing the defenders to guard from two angles. Once inside the main floor, try to set up some people to keep the enemy trapped in the basement (MAX\u2019s and SA is really useful), but send the main force to the CC. If you can get down to the basement, take out the tubes. Try not to have everyone run downstairs, lest the respawned troops escape back to the CC. As you kill people guarding the CC, you can hopefully keep them trapped downstairs, unable to do anything until the tower is yours, leaving them nowhere to spawn, and trapped in a pain field. Like mentioned in the defense section, once you hold the outside, it\u2019s going to be hard for them to take it back, though you should keep an eye open for outside attacks, which are your biggest threat. If your on the outer part of an facilities SOI, or attacking a lone tower, a OMFT can help in keeping people contained, especially in a lone tower, where both doors can be covered. An Aegis Shield Generator can also provide a good hiding place for unmanned vehicles, so they don't fire on them if they start to push out, and soldiers can easily get in them and push them back in. Someone with Assault Engineering can also place spitfires just outside the doors, making for a nasty surprise when defenders try to push out.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Elana/","title":"Weapon tactics","text":""},{"location":"archive/strategy/Elana/#spiker","title":"Spiker","text":"<p> in the Generator room</p>   Tactics (by Elana)"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Elana/#damage-per-shot","title":"Damage per shot","text":"<p>The biggest trick to effective use of the spiker is learning how to make use of the variable power that comes from holding down the trigger.

Don't try to be Rambo in this, even though it feels like a walking tank, it is easy to take these down.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/JamQ/","title":"JamQ","text":""},{"location":"archive/strategy/JamQ/#guide-on-how-to-drain-a-base-by","title":"Guide On How To Drain A Base by","text":"<p>This guide will teach you how to drain a base from 100% NTU.

For this guide I chose Orisha on Cyssor, its at the very bottom of the map and the continent is huge, it has lots of bases and your not going to notice it that easily. When you get to the base either cap the tower nearest the base or bring an AMS with you, the AMS option is preferd but for this guide I capped the tower. (I was on my own and I don't have the cert) Another tip is to always drain a tech plant, this will give you reavers/MBT's</p>   and skyguards, this will make your assault a little easier   What shall I come in? Drive to the base in an ANT, make sure it has full NTU. When you get to the base park it somewhere safe, the wall turrets will shoot you (This is where engineering will come in handy) so park it where the wall turrets wont be able to hit the ANT. For example, this is where I parked mine (The base is a Technology Plant)     If you have an AMS with you, park it outside the base. Now if you have two people, one with an AMS and one with an ANT, deploy outside the base walls     and place the ANT inside the bubble to cloak it from any enemys. Remember to place CE all around the AMS to kill any passers by.   How does NTU draining work? The way NTU works is like this. The Base uses NTU from the NTU Silo to repair things that have been broken inside the facility. The more you destroy the more NTU the base uses up to repair the broken objects. Things inside the base to destroy include: Equipment terminals, Vehicle Terminals, Wall Turrets, spawn tubes (only destroy two, leave one up) And DAMAGE the generator don't kill it.     The following pictures will give you a step by step walk through on how to drain a base. I took theese screenshots as I went along.     1\\) Before you enter the base get on Rexo and fill the layout up with Boomers, Decims/AP and an REK, don't forget the REK. (You can fit another decim in this layout)     \"\"     2\\) Use mines to mine the NTU silo, this will stop enemys ants from getting in and filling up the base.     \"\"     3\\) Once youve done that, start by destroying all of the turrets, it takes about four boomers to kill a turret, so start killing them.     \"\"     4\\) After that start destroying all of the terminals inside the base, this includes medical terminals, equipment terminals, vehicle terminals, air terminals, the lot.     \"\"     \"\"   \"     5\\) Next you will need to down the tubes, but not all of them. Kill only two spawn tubes. This will keep the spawn tubes down icon away from the map, if you destroy them all the icon will stay there until an enemy comes to repair them. You don't need it. REMEMBER, ONLY KILL TWO SPAWN TUBES.     \"\"     6\\) Now sit back and wait, get on agile and wait for the base to turn green. Remember to keep running around the base and look for any terminals that have repaired themselves and destroy them again     7\\) As soon as the base goes neutral, it will turn a light green on the map. Expect the enemy to come now. The continent will now be \"Open\" for hart droppers and its displayed on the map. Work quickly, hack the CC and jump in your ANT and fill the silo. Get your best rexo layout on and defend the hack. :)   \"  If the hack gos through, you win! Congratulations, you have drained a base!   EXTRA TIPS:   \\- Place CE around the Silo and underpasses, includeing the roof     \\- Remember spitfires are your friend, place spitfire turrets all around the base once it turns neutral     \\- Use Rexo for defending the hack, most people will hot drop on the base in agile. Rexo \\&gt; Agile     \\- When damageing the generator, use about 2 Boomers and One deciminator on it, this will damage it without killing it and placeing the gen down icon on the map     \\- If you have Advanced hacking, leave one equipment terminal up (If a tech plant leave the one in the lobby up) Its quicker then going back to the tower/ams for a refill on decims/ce     \\- While draining a base by your lonesome may be fun, it's best done with an organized platoon. This will allow you to better defend the hack. Make sure they stay inside and stay still so as not to alert too much of a presence.     -If you have an extra person with a BFR than use it to drain the silo. You can only get it to 40% though. Also don't try to pull out a BFR at the base, you won't be able to equip the NTU siphon.

While the Prowler and Vanguard are better in specific situations, the Magrider is the most versatile. Your Magrider has a driver weapon, the Pulsed-Particle Accelerator (PPA). This weapon is mainly an anti-infantry weapon, but it can also turn the battle in your favor versus enemy armor. The gunner weapon is the railbeam. Unlike other tanks, this weapon has no arc and travels very fast. It has limited splash damage, and takes three hits to kill a rexo. The Magrider is also unique in that it is the only tank that can travel over water. This is a big advantage.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Magrider_Guide_by_Quovatis/#driver-setup","title":"Driver Setup","text":"<p> driver loadout</p> <p>When you acquire your Magrider you should have a favorite with 4 boxes of PPA and 2 boxes of Rail Beam ammo. This should be your normal loadout, as the PPA goes through ammo quickly. However, if you plan on doing a lot of water driving or long range sniping, you should get 3 or 4 boxes of Rail Beam, as you won't be using the PPA much. Your favorite should also have a spare glue gun, 5 boxes of glue, and perhaps a medpack. This allows you to carry less glue in your infantry loadout, saving space for other things...</p> <p> Favorite for the Magrider</p> <p>If you do a lot of tank driving, you should have a favorite with a box of PPA ammo, a glue gun, a pulsar, glue, a REK (sometimes you might need to take a tower), and whatever else you can get in there. I prefer the Pulsar to the Lasher because you can hot swap with the glue gun directly and it saves space. The Pulsar also provides medium-range fire that the lasher cannot provide if you come under attack while repairing. Have the pulsar in the rifle slot just in case you come across an enemy going to the vehicle pad. If you are CR3 or higher, take a CUD along for clearing minefields or OSing that noob stationary BFR you come across.</p> <p>The implants I recommend are Enhanced Targeting, Darklight, and Audio Amplifier. Always have Audio Amp on, and Darklight lets you run over those pesky cloakers.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Magrider_Guide_by_Quovatis/#driver-tactics","title":"Driver Tactics","text":"<p>Before I go any further, let me say that if your gunner is not on voice comms with you, you're only operating at 50% efficiency. A good driver is worthless if your gunner can't help you out. Your gunner needs to be able to convey threats to you and give you more situational awareness.</p> <p>Your goal while driving is to keep the tank alive. Certain situations dictate that you might need to sacrifice yourself to kill your target, but you need to have the discipline to know when to disengage to avoid death, even though your target just needs 1 or 2 more hits to kill. Getting kills comes naturally, but only if you can keep the tank alive. Disengaging and quickly repairing will yield more kills over time than killing that one tank while getting killed yourself, then pulling a new tank.</p> <p>Your secondary goal is to get kills, or more specifically drive such that your gunner can get kills. The main advantage of the magrider is its long range weapon. You want to keep as much distance between you and your target as possible. Your gunner should let you know if the target is out of range. Find a target. Stay at maximum range and stationary to engage if not under fire. If you are on water, you can move as much as you like, as long as you stay in range.</p> <ul> <li>Roads: Avoid roads if at all possible. Always assume the roads are filled with   mines. If you must drive on the road, drive as far to the side as possible.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Water: Water is your friend. Drive on water whenever possible. If you hug the   shoreline, your speed will not decrease. The main benefit of water is that it   provides a stable surface for your gunner. Driving in long circles out in the   middle of the water allows your gunner to hit almost anything with pinpoint   accuracy, while dodging almost all enemy fire. I've literally done this for 5   minutes with multiple enemies trying to kill us.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Hills: Avoid when you can, as it is very hard for the gunner to hit anything.   However, sometimes getting on top of a hill overlooking a base can yield many   kills. If you strafe while going up a hill, you get more torque out of the   tank, so keep that in mind.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Trees: Trees are the friend of an experienced   Magrider driver, but can be deadly for the   inexperienced. Your tank is not as wide as the other tanks, and you can slip   through the trees and run away easily. Inexperienced drivers will get stuck in   the trees, leading to death many times.</li> </ul> <p>You should be glancing at your mini-map (radar) every second or 2. You need to watch out for Liberators lining you up all the time. Fixating on a target for 5 seconds is enough time for bombs to come out of nowhere and kill you. Pay attention at all times. The minimap also lets you see potential targets. The Mosquito's overflight radar data is transmitted to you as well, letting you see targets you might not otherwise. Motion detectors also give you information, but you will miss it if you don't constantly look at your radar. It also lets you see how the tank your gunner is engaging moves, allowing you to determine which way you need to turn to follow or run.</p> <p>Remember you have a weapon too. Many times you will get killed if you don't use it, but other times you might get too fixated on a target and not pay attention to driving and keeping you alive (your main goal). Lone infantry are perfect prey for the PPA. Hit them a few times with the PPA, then run over them. Always be aware for traps, however. Trying to run over infantry sometimes leads you straight into a minefield. If you find a minefield, stop as soon as possible. Reverse course, and go as you came.</p> <p>Repair whenever possible. If you are less than half health, you need to repair immediately unless you are in a 1 vs 1 battle and you think you can finish them. Even if you are only slightly damaged, repair if you are not under fire, as that extra health might save you in just a few seconds. Usually you want to go away from the battle to repair, but if you're on a good hill or at long range, you can turn your tank to block fire, and repair yourself in battle. While you are out, your gunner is actually more accurate, as the tank will not be bouncing up and down as normal. When repairing, your gunner should do a quick darklight sweep to look for cloakers. If it's clear and you don't expect enemies, the gunner should help you repair. You should almost require your gunner have a glue gun, or else you will spend a lot of time repairing yourself, which is a waste of time. If you have Amp Station benefit, try to repair inside a friendly SOI to build shields while you repair. If you have Dropship Center benefit, get ammo and let your gunner repair you at the repair silo if it's clear.</p> <p>If you drive conservatively, you can live for hours with the same tank, and get 100+ assists easily. Too many tank drivers I gun for drive straight into the battle, and never repair.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Magrider_Guide_by_Quovatis/#target-specific-tactics","title":"Target-Specific Tactics","text":"<ul> <li>Aircraft: Reavers are the main threat here, but all aircraft are treated the   same. You have two choices: try to kill it, or drag him by friendlies. If you   chose to kill it, find water and drive in circles. You gunner should hopefully   be able to kill him easily. If you can't find water, find a relatively flat   spot of ground, and strafe slowly in one direction. This lets your gunner have   a stable platform and you might dodge a few missiles. If there are no flat   spots around, if you are badly damaged, or if the aircraft is smart and flies   almost directly overhead, head for the trees and friendlies.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Lightnings: Not much of a threat. Usually you can   just snipe them at long range, or head straight in for the kill. If there are   lots of them, keep moving to avoid fire. Use the PPA for even quicker kills.</li> <li>Fury: One of your biggest threats. Second only to the   reaver, you should kill these first. The rockets from the   Fury do massive damage. Lure them to open ground where   you can kill them easily.</li> <li>Flight Variant BFRs: These BFRs have   the same top speed as a Mag while in run mode. Get out on water and run in   circles. Disengage if you get badly hurt. You can win 1 on 1 with a flight   variant if you drive well, but engage cautiously. If anything else starts   shooting at you, break away.</li> <li>Sunderer Variants (Vindicator,   Juggernaut, and   Leviathan): Though all very similar in firepower,   the Vindicator has a slight edge because of the high damage of the 20mm and   the projectile veolocity, but you can treat all variants the same. The biggest   threat these vehicles pose is their EMP blast. Stay as   far away as possible to engage, so you stay out of the blast range. Zig-zag to   avoid the 75mm fire, as this is the majority of their firepower. The profile   is so big that it's hard to miss them at any range, so don't be shy about   staying far away. If you come on one them by surprise another tactic you can   use is to stay as close as possible to them. You will stay below their gun arc   (unless they have a ballgunner, but it doesn't do much   damage) and will be relatively safe. However, you are prone to EMP blasts and   the splash from your own railbeam weapon, so only use this tactic if you are   isolated from heavy fighting or know that they already used their EMP.</li> <li>One-Manned Field Turrets: All OMFTs   are similar and suffer from damage degredation. Get too close and you will be   shredded up. The range of the turrets is 250m, so you have 50m more range to   use to your advantage. Avoid close encounters unless you are at full health,   and finish them off if you get the chance, as their shields recharge and you   don't want to waste your efforts.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>New Conglomerate</li> <li>Vanguard: Probably the easiest enemy tank to     kill. While they have the most armor, and heaviest hitting gun, they lack     mobility and rate of fire. However, if you engage at close range, you will     likely die. Engage at medium-long range and move to avoid fire. If you must     engage at close range, use the PPA and weave through trees. If you can't get     the first 3 or 4 rail beam shots on him before he notices you, you probably     need to disengage. If one is following you, head for water, or trees.     Vanguards have a really tough time in trees. When they get stuck in the     trees, circle back and finish them off.</li> <li>Thunderer: I fear this vehicle the most of any     enemy vehicle. It has direct fire weapons, meaning that most of your normal     tactics don't work. Running for water might not be the best choice when     facing thunderers because if they follow you into the water, only half of     their surface area is hittable, while you are no different. Keep as far away     from thunderers as possible, where you still can dodge their slow     projectiles. If you find dueling one at close range, you MUST engage with     the PPA. It is the ONLY way you will win, as the Thunderer with two gunners     has a faster time to kill on a Magrider, than the Rail Beam alone can match.</li> <li>Enforcer: Usually not much of a threat, unless     they are in packs. They are fast, however, which makes killing them a little     tricky.</li> <li>Phoenix: While the Phoenix has a slow rate of fire,     when it does hit, it hurts. Avoid hills where Phoenix users can hide. If     there is just one, close and kill. Watch your minimap for the direction. The     main limitation is its range. When running from Phoenixes, run in a straight     line away from the user. Hopefully the fuse will burn out before it gets to     you. Sometimes weaving in trees can scrape off inexperienced Phoenix users.</li> <li>Peregrine: If it has the particle cannon as the     gunner weapon (which almost all of them do), avoid at all costs. The     particle cannon can kill you very quickly and is very accurate. Don't fire     upon it to let them know you are there, and only fire on it if it's hurting     or others are helping you. The shield regeneration rate of a crouched     BFR is only slightly less than the     damage the rail beam can deliver. You will be shooting at it a very long     time if you think you will kill it alone.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Terran Republic</li> <li>Prowler: This is your biggest enemy tank threat.     At close range, the Prowler will kill you in the     blink of an eye, especially with 2 gunners. Use the same tactics as the     Vanguard above. Stay as far away as possible and     lure them into trees or head for water.</li> <li>Raider: While not as deadly as the     Thunderer, at point blank range, you will still     have a hard time winning. Keep as far away as possible, where the damage of     the raider is less. Like the tactics for the     Thunderer, water might not always be the right     choice.</li> <li>Marauder: Very little threat unless you are     heavily damaged. Pursue and destroy, but watch for their heavy hitting     brothers. This vehicle can carry 3 striker-equipped troops. They pose a     bigger threat when the bail and Striker you. Kill     them before they can bail.</li> <li>Striker: A lone striker is no threat, but it seems     like just about every TR player has one. If you get locked on, head for     obstacles to break the lock. Even if you do break the lock, you need to     change direction, since the rocket can sill hit you if you don't.</li> <li>Colossus: Not as bad as the     Peregrine, but still just as hard to kill. Treat     like a Prowler to avoid fire.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Vanu Sovereignty</li> <li>Magrider: Rarely encountered, but a big threat.     Head for trees, where you will likely make the less experienced magrider     driver get hung up.</li> <li>Aurora: Laugh at them after you kill them. Not a     big threat.</li> <li>Thresher: Keep moving to avoid fire. Treat like     an Enforcer.</li> <li>Lancer: Not much you can do to avoid fire. Find     cover and try to get out of range, though the range is huge. Trees might     help.</li> <li>Aphelion: If you ever find one of these, it's     rare. They have decent anti-vehicular armorment, so it's best to stay away.     It's harder to dodge hits, since the fire is direct fire.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Magrider_Guide_by_Quovatis/#gunner-guide","title":"Gunner Guide","text":"<p> gunner loadout. Replace the CUD with two more boxes of glue if not CR3 or above. More glue should always be in the trunk.</p> <p>As stated before, ideally you need to be on voice comms with your driver. You don't have time to type \"I see a vanguard on the other hill, steady me for a second\". If you know you will be gunning, your loadout should carry two boxes of rail beam ammo and one box of PPA. You should have a glue gun, and a Lasher if you have it certed, though a Pulsar is fine too. You don't need to carry more than 1 or two boxes of repair juice, since hopefully your driver has plenty in the trunk if you run out. Recommended implants are Enhanced Targeting and Darklight. The third slot is up to you, but Audio Amplifier is probably best.</p> <p>Like driving, the gunner needs to be looking at the radar screen every few seconds. It might alert you of that cloaker that is right next to you or a liberator lining you up. If you see puffs of green smoke ahead, that's likely an enemy cloaker laying mines down. Anticipate where he is and shoot him. Don't fixate too much on any given target. While you're firing at that Prowler a mile away, your driver might have just run into a Thunderer at point blank range and needs your help pronto.</p> <p>Your main goal while gunning is to defend the tank. Your secondary goal is to attack targets. Thus if you are chasing a Vanguard but a Reaver is killing you, you need to direct fire at the Reaver first.</p> <p>You should always target the least armored and most heavily armed targets first. A rough order of threats that you should engage when on the defense:</p> <ul> <li>Reaver: Probably your biggest threat, so they should   always be priority if you know they see you.</li> <li>Fury: Very damaging weapon, but relatively easy to   kill. Kill first.</li> <li>AV MAX units:   Falcon is not much a threat, but if a   Pounder if firing at you, it should be second only to   the reaver, as they can kill you very quickly.</li> <li>Nearby Anti-Vehicular Troops: If you have a good line of sight on them, target   them before enemy tanks. But if they are hiding behind trees or cover, ignore.</li> <li>Tanks: Low on the list, but they have high firepower if they are nearby.</li> <li>Thunderer and Raider: Low   armor, but high damage output. As stated earlier, we want to avoid contact at   close range, but if you do, these should be second only to the reaver.</li> <li>Assault Buggies: Not much of a threat, so these should be a very low priority   when under fire.</li> <li>Sunderer Variants: Moderate threat, but takes a long time to take down. Engage   if it's the only threat, but ignore if there are deadlier enemies out there.</li> <li>Mosquito Usually not much of a threat, but likely a   quick take-down.</li> <li>BFRs: Lowest of all, since you almost   ask for death if you start shooting them. If they are hurt or others are   engaging with you, take them out.</li> </ul> <p>On the attack, you should be targeting AMSes, tanks, and MAX units in that order as priority, though it's never bad to work in a quick infantry kill when possible.</p> <p>When your driver stops to repair, do a quick darklight sweep of the area to check for cloakers, especially near Lodestars. After that, you need to make a judgment to either help repair, or stay in the gun. Only experience will help you make the decision.</p> <p>The most important job of the gunner is to communicate the surroundings to the driver, which is best done through voice comms. If you are pursuing a target, the driver usually knows the situation quite well, though if something starts attacking you from behind, you need to start talking to the driver. If something is following you, YOU need to become the commander of the tank. If the target following you is hurting badly, and you're a little better off, but the target stops following you, you need to make a decision. One choice would be to tell the driver to turn around and finish him off, though if you think it's too big a risk, tell him to keep running. The driver can't see behind you, so you need to tell him what's happening. When on the attack, you need to talk as well. You should be saying things like \"steady me for a second\", \"no shot, move left a little\", \"target is out of range\", \"target is down, we're clear\", or \"get us out of here\". Without the driver having this information, you're only running at 50% efficiency.</p> <p>A good driver and gunner can easily play for 3 hours and have a 50 to 1 kill to death ratio. You will get killed, there is no avoiding it, but by following this guide, you will have already made your mark...for quite a long time hopefully.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Magrider_Guide_by_Quovatis/#new-ce-addendum","title":"New CE Addendum","text":"<p>With the addition of the new Combat Engineering, several new tactics can be introduced. The main change for tank drivers is the use of the Aegis Shield Generator. By having an FDU either in you or your gunner's inventory, or in your mag's trunk, you can make a cloaked repair station. When you get out to repair, place an Aegis down beside you. This will cloak you while you repair. If you plan on coming back to the same spot for a while, you might consider charging the shield up to provide even more cover. Note, however, that charging the shield takes a signigicant amount of \"glue\", time, and the FDU takes up a lot of room to store. Thus, be sure you still have enough glue to repair the mag itself, as you cannot get more from the Aegis. Usually it's not worth the time to charge the shield, but the cloaking effect is well worth it.</p> <p>Cerberus Turrets are also a nice addition for tank drivers. Place 1 or 2 of these at your repair site to scare away enemy air cav. You can also set up many more in a single area and use it as a retreating point to scare off that Reaver that is chasing you.</p> <p>The new Anti-Vehicular Wall Turret can make quick work of a mag. The damage per second is roughly equivalent to the Prowler! These upgraded turrets should be taken out whenever possible. Treat like a Colossus: stay far away and strafe to avoid fire and engage with the long range of the rail beam.</p> <p>TRAPs are usually not a great concern to a Magrider.

It packs a hefty punch and spews bullets at an alarming rate. It's range is superior to both the lasher and jackhammer making it a better choice in an outdoor situation(it is most effective at 25-30 metre range) although it does suffer at range against medium assault weapons. It has a very large clip (100) but can sill run out of bullets quickly. The major problems with the MCG are its weakness at close range and it's massive CoF (cone of fire) bloom after taking the slightest bit of damage or afterit shoots 13 shots at full auto. It is good on defence as it is able to lay down a wall of fire no non MAX unit will want to get through. It is best combined with rexo armour as you do not need agility (unlike the JH) and the extra armour can save your life.</p> <p>JH (Jackhammer): The Jackhammer is the NC HA weapon. It is a triple barrelled combat shotgun which can make mincemeat of the enemy IF you get close enough (10- metres is optimum range). It can kill in about 3 shots against non-MAX armour and doesn't require too much aiming. The main problem is having to get within that optimum range and the fact that unlike the TR and VS the NC can't lay down a wall of fire with their weapon and have to rely on other tactics. Problems include it's slow reload time, it's sometimes rubbish secondary fire and the massive penalty for missing. The JH is best used combined with agile armour in order to get close enough to the enemy before you are turned into small chunks of meat (or in the case of the VS a barbeque rib). The jackhammer isn't very good outdoors but if you can get in close....It's deadly.</p> <p>The lasher: Some may call it a spam weapon but it does require some skill to learn how to use it effectively. It has a decent rate of fire and like the minichaingun it can hold down a backdoor for ages. It's lasher orbs only do a bit of damage (around 10 hp) but it can be worth it as it not only hurts multiple enemies but messes up their CoF. It's optimum range is around 15 metres so it is excellent in indoor fights. It's inaccuracy makes it weak outdoors compared to MA weapons or the MCG but this depends on your skill. It's major problem is it's slow moving projectiles meaning that an enemy can hit you before you have the chance of hitting them.</p> <p>The maelstrom (AT): This is an ancient tech (AT) weapon meaning it can only be used IF you both own the core combat expansion and have access to a cave terminal, cave lock and/or equipment module. It is extremly powerful in each of it's modes. It's first mode is the Vortex Whip. This is like a stream of electricity which damages an enemy for as long as you keep the crosshairs on him. The second and third modes fire out a grenade that works simarily to the Thumper. The grenade explodes causing splash damage to those nearby and does incredible damage. Further, the grenade splash damage can jump from person to person as long as each successive link in the chain is at 5m or less from the previous person. The maelstrom benefits from certain mods which recharge it's ammo making it able to hold backdoors by consatntly spamming the area.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Minignus_grunt_help/#medium-assault","title":"Medium Assault","text":"<p>Punisher: Known to many as the \"Swiss army knife\" of PS weaponry, the Punisher is versatile but lacks focus. It's grenade launcher is extremely slow to reload leaving you vulnerable after you fire your shots. A common mistake for new players is that the punisher's rocket is good at AV. It isn't. The damage amount is small and the slow reload time leaves you easy prey for any nearby enemies. In most cases it is easier just to throw a grenade than use the grenade launcher and without it the punisher is a sub-par infantry weapon. It is probably best to avoid unless you are experienced with it.</p> <p>Sweeper: The sweeper is a useful weapon indoors if you can learn to use it properly. It has enough power to take out most infantry in 4 shots if you can make them all land. This weapon has limited application outside as it is a shotgun but inside it can be deadly if you can get within range. With a decent clip, good punch and fair refire rate, the sweeper is a sound weapon.</p> <p>Cycler: The Terran Republic's Medium Assault is a well rounded weapon. Compared to the other empire specific Medium Assault weapons, they have a bigger clip (50 compared to 30) and faster fire rate. It is accurate in short bursts but blooms when fired for too long.</p> <p>Gauss rifle: This is the New Comglomerate's empire specific weapon and in line with their empire's way of thinking it deals the most damage per shot and so can take out a rexo in only 10 shots. It has a small clip (30), a slower refire rate and slightly less accuracy than the cycler.</p> <p>Pulsar: My personal favourite, the pulsar has very good accuracy, high damage and an ability to switch the weapon to fire AP rounds without having to reload. It has a medium clip (40 rounds) and makes a cool noise (obviously a plus). I Try to loot as many of these as possible as i seem to get good kill streaks with them.</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Minignus_grunt_help/#special-assault","title":"Special assault","text":"<p>Thumper: This is a very versatile and powerful weapon in the hands of an experienced player but can be difficult for the new player to use.

It also has some   (but not much) damage against MAXes.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Plasma grenades: Extremely powerful but unpredictable, these weapons can do   serious damage to enemies but also can be \"grief machines\" if used   uncorrectly.

Boomers can be used to take out unwary snipers, turrets and unwary troops with   ease. By deploying a boomer at the back door of a facility you can get the odd   kill very easily. Boomers are also useful for taking down generators, spawn   tubes or terminals meaning a single infiltrator can really slow down enemy   proggress. Spitfires are handy in the field or on defence. They are likely to   draw enemy fire from you but it may mean the enemy can realise you are nearby   so strategic placing is encouraged. Mines are great for infiltrators as they   are seriously dangerous against vehicles and MAXes. Even if the enemy sees you   you may be able to get a kill depending on your reactions. If a MAX sees you   simply jump behind him and lay a mine to take off about 1/2 health and armour.</li> </ul> <p>Boomer damage table hijacked from iluvthequasar's thread:</p> <p><code>*1 boomer: ANY terminal, ATV, infantry, Spitfire turret</code></p> <p><code>*2 boomers: Lightning, MAX, any Buggy, Reaver, Mosquito, Unmanned FV, Spawn tube</code></p> <p><code>*3 boomers: Deliverer and Variants, ANT, Liberator</code></p> <p><code>*4 boomers: Wall turret, MBT, Sunderer, AMS, Unmanned GV, Galaxy, Lodestar</code></p> <p><code>*6 boomers: The Generator</code></p> <ul> <li>Advanced hacking: An easy if boring way to help your empire is take towers   behind enemy lines. If you take a tower you are distracting troops of the   opposing empire or providing a helpful spawn point for your own troops. You   can be handy to your empire by being the first into a CC and taking it   quickly. Also consider certing uni-MAX and taking one out in an enemy base for   some nasty suprises... Also it helps to have a way to replenish your supplies   in the field and using adv hacking you can easily get a few aces or anything   else you need. Of course you can also steal an enemy tank and if you find one   an AMS.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Air cav: Some people see this as a MUST HAVE for cloakers. I can see their   point as it gives an infiltrator a quick and safeish mode of transportation.   The reaver is an undeniably handy and versatile vehicle useful for   recannaisance, tank busting, infantry killing, hotdropping, dogfighting....the   list goes on. The mossie is a better choice for the infiltrator though because   of it's speed, immunity to radar and inbuilt radar makng it the better choice   to hotdrop and perhaps infiltrate enemy facilities.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Ground support: Both the router and AMS have their uses to the cloaker.   Firstly we have the AMS. Because of it's cloaking bubble and equipment   terminals it's the obvious choice for a rallying point. Also the fact that you   can spawn at it is an obvious plus. However the players that spawn from it are   likely to attract attention and the odd OS making it risky. The router's   telepad can be a hell of a use for the cloaker as it allows you and you're   mates easy access to the enemies base helping you in any objectives you may   have.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>ATV: Now we come to the wraith. It is fast and maneuverable and more   importantly invisable which is of course handy for getting from A to B.   However it really comes into it's own as a supply depot. It's massive   inventory means you can stuff it full of medpacks, ACEs, pistols....anything   really. Deploy it near an objective (a bridge that needs mining, a gen that   needs dropping, snipers that need killing) and you will see how useful it   really is. Why not use an AMS? Well the wraith is less noticable. It is   unlikely to be seen by the enemy if you hide it well and even if it is   noticed, most people will ignore it anyway. And it is only one cert point with   the switchblade, basilisk and fury thrown in too! Bargainous.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Uni-MAX: As said above can be very fun if combined with advanced hack.   Imagine spawning at a safe base and walking into a deployed dual-cycler   max.... ouchie. Also it's nice to make a change now and then.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Minignus_infiltrator_startup/#implants","title":"IMPLANTS","text":"<ul> <li>Darklight: Useful to keep an eye out for the competition. Makes you look   kinda stupid if you get stabbed by an enemy cloaker while going for that   sniper kill. Although i tend to not kill other cloakes unless they attack me   (honour and all that) some people will just go for them and turn into a   cloaker hunter. It's really up to your playing style.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Sensor shield: I can't stress this enough this is ESSENTIAL FOR ALL   CLOAKERS. It stops spits form killing you without you getting a small chance,   stops mossies nailing you, nerfs the enemies radar and stops gen pain   fields... all these things are useful for the cloaker in their day to day   lives (and deaths...).</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Surge: can be handy if you don't have access to transport or if you are in   a tricky situation and need to escape. I tell you a surging infiltrator is   difficult to see let alone HIT. I remember when i had it and kept surging out   of a surrounded spawn room and dropping boomers behing enemy squads camping   the corridors. 5 kills in one go...ouch.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Enhanced targetting: You never really notice this one unless it isn't   there.... Being able to see health of everything is one of the best abilities   in the game. You can see that the lightning over there will explode with one   more mine or that sniper will keel over if you whack him with your knife just   once.... Being able to see if someone has DL activated is great to and can be   a real life saver.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Melee booster: This really depends on your play style. Killing someone in   only two knife hits is satisfying but this cert is only worth it if you are   knifing people constantly. Most people will pass this over in favour of just   using a normal melee attack, a pistol, grenade or ACE.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Personal shield: I'm sure there are some cloakers who use this but there   is no real point. If you get attacked your only real defence is to kill the   enemy or run away before they draw their weapon. It's best left to the surgile   or rexo players of the world.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Audio amplifier: A nice implant for scouts as you can see (or in this case   hear) the enemy coming from a while off. This can get you out of many tricky   situations but again it depends on your playstyle. If you are spending long   times outside hunting AMS', vehicles and snipers you may not have much of a   need for this implant.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Second wind: Lets face it this isn't the best implant in the world. In   fact it's pants. Giving you the slightest of boosts (25 health + 25 stamina)   in situations that will probably leave you dead anyway. Even the players who   play as grunts and expect to take heavy damage don't take this.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Regeneration: Perhaps you may be able to find use for this but that   stamina could be used elsewhere (say on DL or SS) and in my personal opinion   (and here comes all the pro cloakers laughing at me) if you are shot at you   are compromised and probably dead already. If you find you can escape these   situations you may find this handy.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Minignus_infiltrator_startup/#your-tools","title":"YOUR TOOLS","text":"<ul> <li>Knife: The ever handy and versatile knife. If put on secondary can kill   agiles and rexos in about 3 swings and if teamed up with melee booster (see   above) kills in two. Useful on pheonix users as they are unaware of their   surroundings when firing and also useful on snipers.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Plasma grenades: Being standard assault all can benefit from these. 3   direct hits if timed correctly takes down an agile/rexo and one direct hit on   an infil will kill it dead (needless to say DON'T drop them.) with 30 of them   able to fit in your inventory this means you can kill a fair few before having   to resupply. HOWEVER the first thing someone will do if plasma grenaded in the   middle of nowhere is turn on dark light. The best way to counter this is to   sit on towers and walls as for some reson noone will check there. Go figure...</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Frag grenades: As they make an explosion similar to many, many, many   things in ps and make a comparable noise these are stealthier than plasma and   do more damage to MAXes and vehicles. However they do less damage to infantry   as a tradeoff and it is unlikely that you will be able to kill a MAX or   vehicle with it. Probably best to stick with plasma grenades in most (but not   all)cases.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Jammer grenades: Ahhh the ever useful jammer. It can be used for many   things as a cloaker. Stopping someone being able to detect you with DL or AA   is the most used one. Also you can use 'em to clear mines or silence   spitfires. Stopping tanks firing at you or your mates is great as well. My   favourite use for them though is as traps. By sticking down a solid mass of   boomers in say, a tech plant vehicle driveway you can blow up pretty much   ANYTHING. You can detonate enemy mines to clear CE and blow up enemy tanks in   a semi-ironic way or use them to set up explosves around a generator and take   it down in one smooth blow.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>AMP: The automatic machine pistol is useful but not my preferred choice.   It can spew out bullets fast and is excellent for close up combat. It however   does suffer from massive COF and isn't exactly subtle or covert... I think it   does have the shortest TTK though (testing it out soon) so if you get the jump   on the enemy you can probably take them down.</li> </ul> <p>http://www.phantomphoenix.com/Planetside/TR-Repeater_small.jpg</p> <ul> <li>Repeater: Powerful, accurate and long range (for a pistol) this is the   closest thing a TR infiltrator gets to a sniper rifle. It can be used to hit   enemies from out of DL range and if you are carful you can avoid detection.</li> </ul> <p>http://www.phantomphoenix.com/Planetside/NC-MAG-Scatter_small.jpg</p> <ul> <li>Mag-scatterpistol: The shotgun-like pistol of the NC is only useful   upclose for obvious reasons. It's heavy power means you can easily kill off   wounded enemies (which is a little unsporting) or cloakers. It's short range   means you have to exercise caution but if used correctly this is a good   weapon.</li> </ul> <p>http://www.phantomphoenix.com/Planetside/VS-Beamer_small.jpg</p> <ul> <li>Beamer: The VS laser-gun-type-thing (technical term) is powerful and fast   firing. It is similar to both the AMP and repeater and is cited by a few as   the best standard assault pistol available. It's projectiles are easily   spotted though meaning you can be asily seen and VS ammo can be hard to find   in the field if you run out. These are minor gripes though.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Spiker: The ultimate pistol, this is only available if you own core   combat. It has potential to have MASSIVE stopping power and it's   maelstrom/lasher style lashes make it excellent against tight formations or in   indoor combat. It chews up ammo quickly though and has the unfortunate ability   of making you light up like an...um...light. Still very worth it though.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Laze targetter: Not as useful as it was thanks to the lack of flails these   days, this tool used to be very handy. It is still useful for marking targets   for OSes, EMPes or bombing strikes. Can be used to point your squad towards an   AMS if you find one too.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>CUD: Obvious uses really so i don't need to say much. EMP is one of the   first things to do when you drop from a gal.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Med app: Some people carry these in order to keep themselves alive during   an infiltration but they take up 1/5 of your inventory losing you space that   could be used for an ACE or other useful item. Personally I use Medi-kit   drops. I simply stick a couple of med kits in my locker or in the trunk of a   vehicle and use them when i need them. I could also hack a term or steal them   from other people but this is less likely to attract attention while   infiltrating.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Minignus_infiltrator_startup/#tactics-and-gameplay","title":"TACTICS AND GAMEPLAY","text":"<ul> <li>Keep an eye on what you are doing: If you are playing as an infiltrator   and not a cloaker try to keep an objective in mind. The difference being   between these two roles is that a cloaker will try to infiltrate an enemy base   in order to help his or her empire whereas the cloaker is playing for kills   (yes I know these are large generalisations). When infiltrating keep in mind   your objectives at all times. For example you may be sneaking into an enemy   base to destroy and hold down vehicle terminals or going for a generator drop   then remember to head in those directions and try not to get side tracked   (this doesn't mean you shouldn't go for targets of oppertunity....Just try to   get done what you set out to do). If you are playing as a cloaker then try to   keep aware of both your target and the people around him. Many a time have i   seen a cloaker being gunned down by someone watching their teammates back.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Remember to hide: You are NOT invisible unless you are completely   still not using anything. Although it is pathetic some people use a gamma hack   to see cloakers a lot easier than usual, however you can easily counter this   out in the field. If you see someone who has noticed you pretend you don't   know and move to get behind a large hill or rock and lay down a spitfire or   two and if you have time a couple of mines. As soon as he gets there he will   be shot, exploded and then he is easy pray to a quick knife attack. Grrrr.   Also remember to use cover when possible. It makes you harder to see and hit.</li> </ul> <p>MORE SOON...</p> <p>If you like killing tanks while in cloaker mode go to Haskins' ninja tank busting thread : here</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Mudwink/","title":"Mudwink","text":"<p>Guide to TR MAX</p> <ul> <li>this is not ment to be a comprehensive guide for new users but should offer   some assistance and insight to new MAX users. Especially you Newb Uni-MAX   owners.</li> </ul> <p>The TR MAX units, in my opinion are the best in the game. Although they are underpowered compared to the other factions MAX units during normal operations their special ability (liability and asset) to anchor down makes them incredibly powerful. I will comment on each of the armament types seperately.</p> <p>AA MAX: BURSTER his MAX has the unique ability to target and often seal the fate of enemy aircraft before they even know what hit them. This is due to the fact that the flak MAX is dumb fire mode only. Since it has no missle lock warning, this MAX can fire (especially at range) all the projectiles required to destroy the aircraft before the first shell explodes. To be effectively employed you must find an area to anchor down that avoids exposure to enemy fire and allows you to overlook an area where aircraft will be spwawning, repairing, or hovering (ie around bases that are under siege). Then you just have to anchor down and wait for your chance. I recommend finding high ground whenever possible. The splash (explosion) radius of the rounds when they approach an enemy aircraft will allow you to target aircraft around bases even when they are seeking cover or can no longer be seen.</p> <p>This MAX weapon is truly only effective against aircraft. Remember this when you think about attacking that armored vehicle... you are going to lose. If you get surprised by a softie, even in the rexo suit you can win a one on one battle provided you do some straffing and the opponent doesnt have anti vehicular weapons. Once again though, you will be damaged a lot and likely be killed soon after.</p> <p>AV MAX: POUNDER This is the best all purpose MAX for the TR. The mortar projectiles do substantial damage to personnel and aircraft (although hard to hit) in addition to vehicles and MAX units. I cant swear to this but I am not sure that any other MAX has a faster time to kill (TTK) then the Pounder when it is anchored. For that matter if you are anchored in the AV MAX I would engage anything that appears in front of you if good cover/escape isnt easily and quickly available. The reason for this is, first you will likely die thrying to escape anything you arent willing to engage anyways. Secondly the Pounder does so much damage to most targets that you will mortally wound, drive away or destroy many targets if you just get to work on killing them. Dont think I am crazy... you will almost always lose to Reavers, Gunships, Tanks, and BFRs. However, if you are anchored and get the drop on an enemy you will be amazed how quickly you can kill them. Try to find enemies that are already engaged with other friendlies. If you can get the first full magazine on target before they recognize you the enemy vehicle will most likely bail out of the fight or be destroyed.</p> <p>This MAX is also great for any area where there is a bottle neck. It pairs well with the dual cycler for back door, tower and other doorway defenses where the explosion damage almost guarantees hits. Dont forget that even though the indirect fire of this weapon makes hitting difficult it also can allow you to attack enemy vehicles over base walls. The secondary fire mode (three second delay) is useful for clearing out hallways and to a lesser degree bouncing around corners.</p> <p>AI MAX: DUAL CYCLER Finally we come to the anti-infantry max for the TR. This weapon (like all TR weapons) has a high rate of fire and large magazine size. The weapon is extremely effective against soft targets and is capable of dizzing rate of fire. One issue with this weapon system is knowing when to anchor and when not to. The combination of armor and damage to softies allows you to win almost any one on one battle (and many against multiple enemies)... damn decimators, not fond of the lancer either... at close to medium range. You can use this to incredible effect in close confined quarters. You do suffer damage degredation at range so keep this in mind. Please save your time and help out the TR by not getting carried away... although it seems like you can take on anything (lasers and muzzle flash are sweet) you have little chance against anything other then softies. I have destroyed noob mosquito pilots when anchored but I dont recommend attacking anything but softies. What will happen is... their damage indicator (red directional flashes) will blow up due to the number of hits and they will then turn and kill you. I wouldnt even use it against other MAXs unless you have to.</p> <p>Strategy tips... We all know that the decimator, phoenix, and lancer will kill you in no time flat. We all know you are a big target and draw a lot of attention due to the amount of hurt you can put out and the fact that you are fairly easy to kill. We should all know that a MAX suit makes you want to charge in all doors and take on all armor, which is a bad idea. This could go on forever but this isnt about general MAX strategy. On to the other TR issue...</p> <p>To Anchor or not to Anchor: If you have played (or read about) a TR MAX then you know that the ability to anchor is a gift and a curse. On the one hand you shrink your cone of fire, and almost double the rate of fire. On the other you become stationary, and loose the ability to fire and address any threat that isnt in front of you. I will make this as simple as possible since your playing style and experience will teach you more about this decision then anything I can write.</p> <p>Basically, if you are defending an area, or entrance way you should anchor down. if you have other supporting TR with you to guard your back or a wall is handy (to guard your back) anchor down. If you sneak up on, get the jump on, or see an opportunity to really throw down on a target anchor down. If you know you are going to die and are trying to take as many with you as you can, anchor down.</p> <p>The harder part is learning when not to. If you can easily be flanked, dont have cover to your rear or are surprised by a superior enemy (ie, tank, BFR, AV troop) dont anchor down. Also beware of hallways where you can be easily hit \"stick and move\" style with decimators.</p> <p>In short, I have gotten more kills by far when anchored down and giving them hell then I ever have just standing up and staying mobile. When in the thick of battle, I must also say that along with those kills, anchoring has dramaticly shortened my life expectency.</p> <p>AMENDMENT: A recent change to Terran MAXs... The powers at be have added a max capacitor which allows a noticible increase in rate of fire without anchoring down. It is all or nothing (once initiated it cant be stopped) and gives a valuable new resource to users. Although fairly short in duration the capacitor ability gives you the oportunity push forward while laying down increased firepower. This ability is quite usefull when pushing into spawn rooms, up tower stairs, and attacking CCs. I havent had enough of a chance to use it to issue a verdict. Good luck with the new tool.</p> <p>Enjoy the firepower TR and happy hunting.</p> <p>--Mudwink 13:40, 31 October 2007 (EDT)Mudwink</p>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/NeoPhoenixTR/","title":"NeoPhoenixTR  THE BFR Hunters' Handbook","text":"<p> <p>This guide has become outdated</p> <p></p> <p>It shall remain here for reference (and some nostalgia). I regret not being able to finish it. Thanks to all those that supported me in my campaign to both hunt the BFRs of the world, and teach other players how to turn it into an artform. -NeoPhoenixTE/TR</p>   About the Author   If you'll pardon the ego, I'd like to give a lil history before I start preaching about this.  I go by the alias [NeoPhoenixTR](http://www.planetsidestats.net/players.php?world_id=15&amp;char_id=751022)(NeoPhoenixTE on the [forums](http://comms.planetsidesyndicate.com/member.php?userid=144), and the rest of the net), and my main character is an [Emerald](../servers/Emerald.md) [TR](../../factions/Terran_Republic.md) [CR5](../../terminology/Command_Rank.md). I have been playing PlanetSide for nearly two years now, but have always been mediocre at shooter games overall. My expertise comes in niche strategies and multitasking... just not aiming. \\&gt;\\_\\&gt;  Ever since [BFRs](../../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md) were first brought into the game, I have had a constant fascination with them. True, some of this has come from my personal love of the \"mecha\" genre of Anime, but it was also a new dimension to the game. Many hated them, and still hate them, and that saddens me. Despite what many may think, I love BFRs. However, like everything in my life, the more I like something, the more I like to break it. I work on computers and networks for a living...and I literally learned everything by breaking, well, everything.  Sometime ago, the [Markov](../servers/Markov.md) TR named [Blahman](http://www.planetsidestats.net/players.php?world_id=3&amp;char_id=384070) released a [movie showing how to destroy a BFR as a solo grunt](http://www.planetsidemovies.com/modules.php?name=Downloads&amp;d_op=viewdownloaddetails&amp;lid=1088&amp;title=How_to_Solo_a_BFR.wmv). I watched this movie, and it got me to thinking about his approach. Soon after, I had found myself dropping on BFRs and destroying them, each drop giving me more experience for the next. It has been well over five months since then, allowing me to alter and perfect the simple methods in Blahman's movie into a more precise and effective method.  Most BFR pilots on Emerald know of my incessant love of \"BFR Hunting\" (or \"jihading\" as people call it, but I _hate_ that term and wish it would get replaced). In some cases, these pilots have come to fear this technique and my name, despite the fact this was never the intent, ever. I was just bored and found something I'm good at. :(  I am the first holder of the [BFR Buster Platinum Merit](../../merits/BFR_Buster.md) and have over 850 BFRs kills recorded using the technique I will describe on this page. So, suffice it to say, this technique works.  Those of you who wish to witness this technique in action are welcome to watch my movie: [Rampage of the BFR Hunter](http://www.planetsidemovies.com/modules.php?name=Downloads&amp;d_op=getit&amp;lid=2170).   About this guide   This handbook will attempt to explain the \"art form\" of BFR Hunting.  Why am I writing something so long? It seems people always ask me how I do this, or how I do that, or what I recommend, or what about this. This handbook is to answer every last one of those questions, and give recommendations. I will be updating this guide over time (hopefully not _too_ long) as I go. Like I said, should answer any questions I get (and make them stop :\\|).  A second answer to that question could be that I like information. I like having it, and I like making it. I compile stats for my outfit, [KAAOS](../outfits/KAAOS.md), about our outfit nights and turn it into a 1-page overview once the numbers are available from [Rev's PlanetSide Stats page](http://www.planetsidestats.net), and use it to draw conclusions on our performance that night. I'm just an information nut is all.  I also like helping people out. During the writing of this guide, I have gotten alot of good comments and critiques on it. People have loved it as I write it, and I love writing it for people. During it's writing I had shown it to my outfit, people who visit the [Syndicate Comms](http://comms.planetsidesyndicate.com/), as well as very few select people who have wanted to get into BFR Hunting who weren't part of the first two groups. ;)  This guide is scheduled for public [official forum](../../etc/Planetside_Official_Forums.md) release upon completion.

The loadout to the left satisfies the minimum conditions with the 3 Decimators, and the Jammer. Also, note that the first Decimator is in the active rifle (or number 2) holster. The [Sweeper Shotgun](../../weapons/Sweeper.md) is a good choice for a defensive weapon from the [Medium Assault](../../certifications/Medium_Assault.md) pool. It specializes in close-combat, and is common-pool, so the price is right. The [REK](../../weapons/Remote_Electronics_Kit.md) is totally optional. It's recommended if you have [Advanced Hacking](../../certifications/Advanced_Hacking.md), and it's also a good idea to keep a REK on you at all times anyways. ;)  **WARNING!** _Make sure your defensive weapon is loaded with standard (white) ammo!

Make sure you leave that spacing there, meaning putting your gun all the way on the left side of the inventory backpack. The reasoning behind this space is simple. When you swap your defensive weapon (the Sweeper in this case) into your active rifle holster, you wont drop the Decimator that was in your active holster while in combat.

This is the loadout I personally use when BFR hunting.  Since we're now using Heavy Assault weapons, the common-pool weaponry is out the window. This is where problems can occur between empires. Given the empire-specific weapons, the [TR](../../factions/Terran_Republic.md) and the [NC](../../factions/New_Conglomerate.md) have the best defensive HA weapons, while the [VS](../../factions/Vanu_Sovereignty.md) are at a disadvantage.

The NC's [Jackhammer](../../weapons/Jackhammer.md) is like the Sweeper, but bigger, specializing in close-combat. The VS' [Lasher](../../weapons/Lasher.md), however, only has 25 shots, and is at a disadvantage outdoors, where any BFR takedown will be taking place. My recommendation is that any VS BFR Hunter stick to the Sweeper used in the \"Poor Man's Loadout\" described earlier.  **WARNING!** _Make sure your defensive weapon is loaded with standard (white) ammo!

If you keep swapping the same two Decimators, they will both run out, and you'll be stuck firing that third one at \"normal\" speeds (which you may as well just point at the ground cause you are likely screwed by now).

Doing something that complex in such a short amount of time requires practice. With enough practice, the Deci-Swap Technique can become like walking, or typing.

Do it at whatever speed your are comfortable with, and constantly try to increase your speed as it starts to feel more natural. In time, you won't even need to read any notes. You'll just be able to do it! I recommend getting comfortable in this environment before moving onto the next one.    Combat Practice    It's great that you can deci-swap like a champ in a quiet room...but how about when there's gunfire, yelling, and people all around you that want to kill you? Yeah, your concentration may get a bit frayed then.  Try to pack two Decimators in your standard grunt loadouts, and practice the swap against MAX units (and enjoy the \"hax\" tells!) While this wont let you practice switching to the \"third Deci,\" it will allow you to get the motions down while in head-to-head combat.  **REXO WARNING!** _Make sure you have your Decimator in your first active rifle holster (number 2 again). Any Rifle-sized item you swap in will go into that rifle holster!_  This type of practice is the kind the average grunt may be doing already. This same technique has been used to bypass the refire time of a [Bolt Driver](../../weapons/Bolt_Driver.md), much like it bypasses the Decimator refire time.  Another fun way to practice that _does_ let you practice the \"third Deci\" is to use an enemy [Generator](../../items/Generator.md) as a test dummy for your BFR Hunter loadout. Simply load up your agile loadout, wait for surge, surge through to the enemy gen, and swap away while blasting that gen.

They are also places where large armor conflicts could be taking place.</p> <p>Good \"Game trail\" examples include:</p> <ul> <li>Bridges (especally the Ceryshen bridge between Sedna and Anguta)</li> <li>Roads</li> <li>Direct land routes between two bases</li> <li>Areas between towers and their respective base</li> </ul> <p>But, these aren't the only places. This is where use of \"The Force\" may be needed. You need to be able to \"feel out\" your enemy. Quite literally asking \"If I were a BFR pilot looking for kills, where would I go and how would I get there?\" It may be common sense, but, alot of people tend to look for BFRs just at towers and bases.

This would require use of the Enhanced Targeting implant to spot low health bars, or just a keen sense of how hurt a BFR is simply by how it moves. If a BFR is runningaway from a target, good chance that it's probably hurt, or at least in no shape to attack. This also applies to enemy frames that are under attack by friendly forces. I myself tend to drop in on a BFR being targetting by my own empire, seeking both the kill and the glorious cheers from teammates.

Some notes to help use it:</p> <ul> <li>Not Fire and Forget: A common misconception among NC and VS troops is the   Striker is point and click. While the tracking system does mean the rocket   will home in on the target, the target must be kept in the reticule to guide   the rocket all the way in, to be sure of a hit. The nearest equivalent is the   Starfire MAX weapon system.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Range: The Stiker will not lock on to targets more than 250m away. Also,   the rocket itself, if Dumbfired, will tend to timeout (explode) at this   distance anyway. Do not waste rockets on   Liberators at the flight ceiling, you will not   hit, unless at a very high altitude base (Searhus   Crater, Ceryshen Mesas).</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Reloads: Most AV targets will require at least one full clip (5) of   rockets, meaning that anything larger that a MAX unit will need a reload to   kill, dangerously increasing the TTK required. Try to plan accordingly, and   always reload after each salvo; don't holster a half-full Striker.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Outdoor Only: While the Striker can be used indoors, as a general rule   the Decimator is a better choice for close-quarter   battles against MAX units and Spawn/Generator destruction. The Decimator does   much more damage per shot, and you are unlikely to survive for more than two   shots in front of an AI MAX. Change loadout before going inside, if possible.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Not AI: The Striker can kill non-MAX Infantry eventually, but not before   they kill you with almost any MA/HA/SA weapon. A Striker is best used with a   second choice of weapon; even pistols or handheld grenades provide better   Anti-Infantry effectiveness.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Best Used In Packs: Realistically, the lone Striker user can only expect   to solo-kill MAX, Air Cavalry, ATV and Lightning Vehicles. Larger units may be   driven off, but are equally likely to take the hits and return fire, and even   deployed AMS can present problems due to spawning. In packs however, the   Striker can dominate outdoor battle areas; 2+ Strikers will threaten Medium   Battle Tanks, and 5+ will drive off or destory BFRs. Co-ordination is the key   though; if you have a Striker and see another Striker user firing, find his   target and help him out. There is no 'kill-stealing' in Planetside and alone,   neither of you are likely to get the kill. Kills in this manner tend to   average out, as it is largely random who gets the last rocket in.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Use From Cover: Striker users are quickly singled out by tank gunners and   Air Cav pilots, so make sure you have something solid to hide behind; trees,   rocks, base walls and doors. Have an escape route ready if you can. Where   possible, watch the vehicle for a few seconds before opening fire. Choosing a   moment when the vehicle is busy elsewhere before firing can greatly improve   chances of survival and a kill. Once the vehicle knows where you are, you   typically have seconds (One clip; 5 shots) to either destroy it or force it to   flee, before being killed. Having the Striker set to Dumbfire until you're   ready to open fire can increase the element of suprise further, by preventing   the tell-tale 'Missile Lock' warning until you're ready to actually fire.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Run And Gun: The Striker has no appreciable   Cone of Fire bloom, and can be used just as   effectively while running and strafing, as crouching, so if you have been   spotted, you can make it more difficult for them to return fire. If you drive   a vehicle off, but fail to kill it, relocate to a new position as soon as is   practical; he knows where you are, knows you are a threat and will probably be   back from an different direction. This is demonstrated by the 'Reaver   Rocketspam Foxtrot', whereby the Striker user runs toward, then under the   craft, firing all the while, thereby dodging the worst of the hits. This works   more times than you might think.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Inventory Management: Striker ammo boxes are 4x4 in size, so present   difficulties in inventory management. However, it is unlikey any Striker user   will need to carry more than three boxes (45 shots, 9 reloads) in Rexo. You'll   either be dead before they are all used, or near enough a base, tower or AMS   during that time, to resupply. Often two boxes is enough, allowing room for   secondary weapon ammo, and support items. (This holds true for   Lancer and Phoenix users   too.)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Useful When Empty: Unlike the other AV weapons, the Striker remains useful   even when exhausted. Any vehicle being locked by the Striker recieves a big   red 'Missle Lock' warning indicator, with alarming noises. This is effective   in scaring away Air Cavalry and Light Ground units in many cases, even if no   rockets are launched.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>CE Clearance: The Striker will lock on and destroy Spitfire Turrets in one   shot, and in Secondary (Dumbfire) mode can safely destory mines, boomers and   motion sensors, in one shot each. The Striker is suitable for destroying   Phalanx turrets from a safe range as well. Useful if EMP is unavailable.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Other Gear: Striker users will need a backup weapon for Anti-Infantry   work; the Medium Assault Category is   ideal for this, in particular the Punisher (EMP),   and the Sweeper.   Engineering   (BANK) will be useful to patch up splash   damage and rocket spam, as the Striker tends to attract a lot of this.   Combat Engineering compliments AV   well, creating a well-rounded Anti Vehicle Specialist.   Special Assault provides access to the   EMP loaded Thumper, which can disrupt vehicle guns,   prior to oppening fire with the Striker. At a pinch, handheld   Jammer grenades can help, but require far more   practice to land well. Enhanced Targeting   is the single most useful implant for a dedicated Striker user, allowing   progress to be measured and weaker vehicles to be picked off.   Personal Shield can provide a few extra   crucial seconds to get the last rockets in, and Surge   can help the AV trooper to get to cover if it goes wrong.   Reinforced Exo-Suit allows a much needed   back-up rifle slot, and greater survivability outdoors.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Don't Give Up!: AV weapons do not generally yield the same sheer quantity   of kills and xp as HA, and you are basically getting in the way of tanks, on   foot, so you will die lots. However the AV cert makes up for it in quality   of kills, and getting that last rocket in on an enemy BFR can be an immensely   satisfying experience. Regardless, AV does help your Empire, and the more   people that carry it, the more powerful it becomes. And remember, even just   driving the tank away to repair is still a victory, as that is time he is not   spending farming your grunts.</li> </ul> <p>Countering The Striker:</p> <ul> <li>Location: The key to dealing with the Striker, is know where it is. Head   to head, from a standing start, in an open field, the Striker user will lose   to just about everything but MAX units, and even that might be touch and go.   The Striker relies on suprise, and the inital confusion before his position is   revealed, to cause signficant damage. Once he is spotted, the fight turns   against him very quickly, but by this point, sufficient damage may have been   caused to make it academic. Approach the combat area slowly and only charge   once a Striker position has been confirmed. Air Cavalry should always try to   have a full tank of Afterburner ready, as   this will allow the fragile Mosquito and   Reaver to outrun Striker missiles to safety. Less   disciplined Striker users will tend to fire at anything and everything as soon   as it comes into range, and this can pinpoint them quickly to the patient and   observant. Striker rockets in flight show as red dashes on the proximity map,   giving further clues.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Line of Sight: The Striker actually locks to a very small point in the   centre of the vehicle. This means an object as narrow as a single tree can   cause the lock to be lost. If under fire, with no immediate opportunity to   kill the Striker user, head for trees, low hills, rocks, buildings, even other   friendly vehicles, and get them between you and the Striker. Reaquisition of   lock takes a second or so, so a vehicle going full-tilt through a forest   becomes virtually impossible to track.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Avoid Dense Troops: Around 20% of all TR troops have AV certified, so a   fair assumption would be that every fifth TR grunt outdoors is carrying a   Striker, and many others will be carrying some form of EMP. Charging into a   dense pack of such troops is asking for trouble, especially by air, or in slow   ground vehicles. Instead, work at the edges and hit and fade. Locate and pick   off lone Striker users that stray from the herd too much; most vehicles stand   a reasonable chance against a single Striker.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Infiltrate: Striker users generally tend to focus on the sky and horizon,   and so can be more vulnerable than most troops to cloaker attack via AMP,   Boomer or Knife. Time the attack with their own, as the noise from the Striker   will mask any noises your initial attack may make.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Range: As noted above; vehicles are safe beyond 250m. Many vehicle guns   are capable of longer ranges, particularly arcing projectiles, such as the   Vanguard main gun. Use these to retaliate in   saftey.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Send In The Grunts: With the Striker occupying one rifle slot and a   backpack full of very big boxes, even Rexo Striker users are already at a   disadvantage against dedicated HA/SA infantry. Send squadmates or outfit   members in to help distract and flush the Striker's position.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Run MAX, Run: In most cases, the MAX is likely to lose against the   Striker, given enough distance, and suprise. The best defence for the MAX is   cover; if in run-mode, stay in run-mode. You aren't any more difficult to   track, but may be able to make it to trees or cover faster. Walking MAX should   try to return fire if within range, particularly AI MAX, but are likely to be   killed first unless within 20-30m or so. NC MAX can use the shield to buy more   time to reach cover, but in most cases for VS MAX, using the jumpjet is   exactly the wrong thing to do. Stay on the ground, and seek cover, as you are   much easier to hit in mid-air.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Angle of Attack: Particularly useful for Air Cavalry, if the location of   the Striker is known (above), the best way to elimiate him is by aproaching   low from an unexpected direction, ideally over a ridgetop, away from the main   battle area, and cutting them down from behind. The machine guns, used from   range, work best as there is less tell-tale engine or rocket launch sounds to   give the game away.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"archive/strategy/Planetside_Realms_Guide/","title":"Planetside Realms Guide","text":"<p>Congratulations!

The Vanu Sovereignty (purple) are alien technology based. The New Conglomerate (blue and yellow) are based on heavy weapons. Click on one of the empires, then click next in the lower right hand corner.</p> <p>This next screen is the character control screen.

For now, click on the \"Go to Sanctuary\" button and the Play button, lower right.</p> <p>First Steps</p> <p>What you see now is the typical load screen. You will spawn in a respawn tube. Move out of the respawn tube by going forward (default key is 'w') and let's get started. Before I continue, it would be a good idea to familiarize yourself with your keyboard layout. Hit esc and a variety of options will show-up. Hit 'K' for keymapping. Here every possible keymap is available. For those of you who want an inverted mouse, click on the mouse in the upper left. 6 possible boxes including \"invert mouse\" are available. Click esc to close the options window. \"A\" strafes left, \"D\" strafes right., and \"S\" backs you up. Use the mouse to look around.</p> <p>Important: In order to interact with your graphic interface, you must use the mouse arrow. Hitting Tab will allow use of the mouse arrow. You can still move forward, strafe left/right, and backup, but you no longer have mouse look control. The mouse arrow now accesses everything on your interface. To return to mouse-look control, press tab again.</p> <p>As you interact with the world of Auraxis for the first time, text pop-ups will appear. The pop-ups will give you further information about the item you have just seen or used or the action you have just done. If this is your first time playing, it is best if you read all the way through the pop-ups as they have good details and will help you with your adventures.</p> <p>The first one says, \" sanctuary\". You can close the pop-up by pressing esc. Near you will be a waist high terminal with something glowing out of the top. For now, we will skip that. Turn around (mouse movement) and face the tube you just spawned in. If you move forward again, you will receive a pop-up description of the respawn tube. Respawn tubes are all over Auraxis. You can enter the respawn tube and press \"g\" to deconstruct, but we don't want to do that now. There are two doors out of this room. Go out either door.</p> <p>Virtual Reality Training - Weapons</p> <p>The big building outside the door is the HART shuttle building, we will go there later. For now, follow the wall of the building you just came out of. You will see a set of 3 doors. Notice that when you approach the door, it gives the name and distance to object. It should say, \"Training center.\" Go ahead and enter and follow the hallway. You will load a new continent. You will be prompted by 4 options, for now, we want number 1: Shooting Range. You will Load Continent. Here is the virtual reality shooting range.</p> <p>I've been keeping a little secret from you. Each time you try a new event you receive Battle Experience Points (BEPs). This is Sony Online Entertainment's way of saying, \"Hey, there is some important info you need to know, so be sure to check it out.\" While we cruise through this intro guide, you'll be gaining BEPs which is a great thing.</p> <p>Before you go off shooting everything - which we'll do. Press \"I\" to open your inventory. An opaque inventory will show up. Just look for now, we'll be right back. Hit esc to close the box. Press 1 and you're Repeater will come out, walk up to one of the firing lines and empty a clip in something. If you see white crosshairs, you won't hit anything. If you have red crosshairs, you may hit something. If, after pulling the trigger, there is a orange/yellow circle, then you have hit the target. Press 2, your Suppressor will come out, unload a clip. Feel good to shoot something? Good. Hit 'R' for reload. Notice there is a short delay while you reload? In the field you will want to strategically reload whenever you have a chance, nothing worse than having only 2 bullets loaded when you meet the enemy.</p> <p>Now, hit 'X'. This will allow you to switch through the ammo types. You are now loaded up with armor-piercing ammo. It's the yellow ammunition, normal ammo is white. Go ahead and unload the clip. Generally use armor-piercing ammo on Max units and vehicles and standard ammo on infantry.</p> <p>At this time, hit 'I' again and your inventory will open. In your inventory is an REK. Left-click on the REK and put it in the slot 1 where the gun is. See how they hot-swap? You can click on destroy to remove your repeater. Don't worry, guns are \"free\" as long as you have access. More about that later. Press 1 and read about your REK. Keep your inventory open. As you should have read you use the REK to hack locked doors or terminals. Some things can only be hacked with advanced certifications.</p> <p>Remember those waist high terminals we saw when we stepped out of the spawn tube? You should see a number of them in the shooting range room. Walk up to one of those now. Press 'G' to interact with it. Because we are in the Virtual Reality room, you have access to everything. This is not the case in the field so we are going to try everything out.</p> <p>First, click on the armor tab. Currently, you are in standard armor. Lets try on some other armors and see what features they have. Click on agile armor, then in the lower left corner of the equipment screen, click buy. You have now donned agile armor. Click on the infiltration suit and click buy. Notice how the inventory has changed size. Click on reinforced exo suit and buy. Notice how the inventory size changes as well as the number of available weapons. We'll get back to the other armors in a bit. Since we have tried all of these weapons, click on the clear button in the inventory panel. This is used to quickly clear out your inventory. You will be prompted as to whether you want to do this. Click yes, remember, weapons and ammo are free!</p> <p>If the equipment menu is not open, make sure to go back to the terminal and press 'G' again. It should open to the weapons menu. If the menu is open, click on the weapons tab. Let's buy the following guns by clicking on them, then clicking on the buy button: from the pistol menu AMP, from the medium assault your empire specific weapon Cycler (Terran Republic), Lancer (Vanu Sovereignty), or Jackhammer (New Conglomerate), the punisher, the sweeper shotgun, and the bolt-driver. Notice how the AMP automatically fell into slot 1. The Medium Assault weapon fell into slot 3 and the Punisher fell into slot 4. The other 3 weapons were put in inventory. Move on over to the firing line and let's have some fun.</p> <p>Use the AMP in slot 1, the cycler in slot 3 and the punisher in slot 4. You switch by pressing the slot number: 1, 3 or 4. Some weapons have more than one firing method. Press right-click once for each method. The punisher, for example, shoots a rocket. For now, we'll just shoot one clip. Once you have tried each of those guns and the secondary firing systems press 'I' to open the inventory and replace the cycler and punisher with other weapons in the same left-click hot-swap way you did with the REK. Make sure to have some fun with them. Once you have tried all the weapons, clear your inventory and loadup with more weapons. Get the empire specific heavy assault and anti-vehicular, the decimator, thumper, rocklet, and one of each of the 3 grenades. Again, step up to the firing line and try each one out. To gain more distance on a grenade, hold the fire button down longer. After you have tried the 2 grenades and a couple weapons, hot-swap out the other weapons and grenade and keep going. By this time, you should have tried every hand-held weapon your empire offers. If you want to continue to play around with the guns, then have fun. Just come on back to this point in the guide.</p> <p>If you want to learn more about the different weapons you can use in the game at a later point be sure to stop by our weapon list. It's on the left menu or you can click here to read it.</p> <p>Virtual Reality Training - MAX Units</p> <p>Ready to continue? Go back to the terminal and press 'G'. At this point, click on the Armor tab. Those other armors we skipped... well, time to really get crazy. Look down below reinforced exosuit and there are 3 big guns, select the first one. Notice how your inventory has changed. Your hands should have changed too. You are now in a MAX suit. Click \"t\" to see yourself and \"t\" again to return to the terminal. We also need some ammo, click on the ammo box that corresponds to the gun you bought. It's the small box to the right of the gun in the list. Step on over to the firing line and have some fun. Notice how your anti-infantry loadout does little to nothing against other MAX and vehicles. Try each of the MAX loadouts and notice how they do against different targets. You will need to use the 'R' key to reload.</p> <p>Each MAX has a special ability activated with the spacebar. You can learn how these work by checking out our armor information here.</p> <p>Virtual Reality Training - Supply Items</p> <p>Sometime soon you will receive your first battle rank. At this time, press 'O' and your character stats will appear. Look at your experience bar. When you are awarded the next battle rank, open up this screen again and look at it.</p> <p>Return to the terminal. Let's get out of that MAX armor and back into a reinforced exo-suit (under the Armor tab). Clear out the inventory again and then go to the Supply tab. Buy the BANK, Medical applicator and nano-dispenser. Equip each of these and read their pop-ups. Hot swap medical applicator and use it too. You can try these items out on other people in the shooting range.</p> <p>The ACE is a unique item used by combat engineers. It has 4 different modes of operation. Boomers (Manually detonated explosives), Land Mines, Spitfire Gun Turrets and Motion Sensors. Motion sensors are particularly important later in the game as they help a base to use it's automated defenses better (provided your empire owns an Interlink facility).</p> <p>Virtual Reality Training - Vehicles</p> <p>We are done with the Virtual Reality Shoot Range. If you would like to play around some more, feel free. When you are done, step on the green glass to leave. You will be prompted as to where you would like to go. Now, we want number 2. Vehicle Area.</p> <p>You may spawn near an air-terminal or near a vehicle terminal. Either way step on up to the spinning 3 pointed PlanetSide symbol at the terminal.</p> <p>Start at the top and buy each vehicle. If there is any problem, the terminal will prompt you. You can only buy one vehicle at a time. If there is already a vehicle on the pad you need to wait for it to leave before you can purchase a new one. Once the vehicle has spawned move around the driver side door and hop in by pressing 'G'. Some of the tanks and aircraft have a driver's entrance in the front. Feel free to read the pop-up but don't idle too long or the vehicle will deconstruct after a reasonable period of time. Drive the vehicle away from the vehicle pad. Feel free to test drive the vehicle into trees, over hills and through ditches. Park the vehicle by pressing 'S' as a brake. Hop out using \"g\".</p> <p>On the ground will be yellow circles. They designate the positions of the vehicle - driver, gunner, passenger, or trunk. Move to the circles with a gun in a circle (gunner position) and press 'G'. A new pop-up will tell you about this weapon. If a gun has two possible firing option, make sure you right-click to try both option. Do this for every vehicle and every weapon. So as to not make a parking lot of the vehicle area, there is a vehicle control panel button. It is located on a vertical column that is defaulted to appear on the lower right part of your interface. Don't forget you use the tab key to switch your mouse modes to access menus.</p> <p>Click on the car and up will come a \"driver's control\" panel. From here you can lock the car from varying peoples, kick people out, and deconstruct the vehicle. Make sure to deconstruct your vehicle before getting the next one. Once you have tried every air or ground vehicle, it's time to try the other. By hitting 'M' you will pull up a World Map, there is a pop-up for it's description. To add/remove detail to the map, click on the legend in the lower right. To zoom in/out, scroll your mouse. Find a grey square and drive/fly to it. Half the fun is bumping around in the VR getting used to things. The air terminals are about 40 percent bigger than the vehicle terminals. Find the other terminal and try out the other type of vehicles. Once you are finished, you can either hit esc and press \"R\" to recall to sanctuary.</p> <p>The Real World</p> <p>You will spawn back in the respawn tube. That equipment terminal in front of you is still not useful. You're back in the real world now so you only have access to certain things. Exit out one of the doors again, except this time keep running straight ahead to the very tall building. Up top, it will say \"Shuttle\", go in one of the doors. On the ground floor, there are 4 terminals. Walk up to the human-scale with handrails terminal. This is the medical station. These are very useful in the field. Move on over to the implant terminal. It is the one next to the medical station that looks like a giant nutcracker device. Press 'G' and hop in. These are the possible implants. Once you reach battle rank 6 (you should be 2 already!), you receive your first of three implants. Press 'G' to exit.</p> <p>Now let's venture over to the terminal that has the 3 point PlanetSide star floating over it. This should be the certification terminal. Remember when I said you need access to the weapons? Well, this is where you get it. Click on each of the possible certifications in the left panel to check each out or go here to learn more. What do you want to be? How do you want to play? Now is the time to make some decisions.</p> <p>You should have 5 certification points at this time. Before you allocate any cert points, be forewarned you can only \"unlearn\" one certification every 24 hours. If you choose to unlearn a second you will be unable to purchase anything further for 24 hours. When you first start we recommend getting 1 infantry type thing and an Advanced Mobile Station (AMS) certification. This way, you are always right near the action because the AMS system is always popular and allows you to respawn closer to the fights. You should also be able to survive longer because of your infantry cert. As a bonus, you can drive the Advanced Nanite Transport (ANT) which gives you buckets of BEPs when you refill a base.</p> <p>Once you have learned your certifications, move on over to that equipment terminal. Now, make a couple of different load-outs with differing guns, ammo, supplies, and armors. Click on the favorites tab. Click on a blank space, type a name for that loadout, then click save. Next time you interact with an equipment terminal the favorites screen will pop-up first, move your cursor over the screen and press the number you want to use. Double-clicking not necessary. Now, you're ready for action!</p> <p>Squads</p> <p>In order to gain more experience points, focus your attack, and have more fun, I suggest you join a squad. Press tab. Move your cursor over the chat box. There is a LFS tab on the right side of the chat box. Click it. Your name will now have \"[looking for squad]\" underneath it. Press tab to return to mouse look control. If you receive a squad request, there will be a little box in the lower right. Click tab to gain mouse control, then accept by yes, or decline by no, then tab again to return mouse look. Your chat option is still in general speak and not squad speak. If you would like to talk to your squad only, then go to your chat box again with the mouse, choose squad from the droplist.</p> <p>Once you join a squad press 'M'. You may need to zoom in with your mouse scroll. You should see some numbers. Number 1 is always the group leader. You can use this system to find members of your squad. Press 'M' again to leave the map.</p> <p>Time to Fight</p> <p>You're now ready for your first taste in the field. There are 3 ways to enter action. You can take the HART shuttle and drop on any non-locked continent that you decide. You can go to Instant Action by letting the server decide. It is faster, but you don't have control over where you go. You can do this, by pressing esc, then 'I'. Or you can take one of the warp gates to the continent that the warp gate is named by. If you have chosen a vehicle certification, you can create a vehicle at a nearby ground or air terminal. Just drive the vehicle or aircraft into the warp gate and stop, and you'll warp.</p> <p>Good Luck! }</p>"},{"location":"armor/","title":"Armor","text":""},{"location":"armor/#infantry","title":"Infantry","text":"<ul> <li>Standard Exo-Suit (\"Pajamas\" or \"PJs\")</li> <li>Agile Exo-Suit (\"Agile\")</li> <li>Reinforced Exo-Suit (\"Rexo\")</li> <li>Infiltration Suit (\"Cloaker\")</li> </ul>"},{"location":"armor/#mechanized-assault-exo-suits-max","title":"Mechanized Assault Exo-Suits (MAX)","text":""},{"location":"armor/#new-conglomerate","title":"New Conglomerate","text":"<ul> <li>Falcon</li> <li>Scattercannon   (\"ScatMax\")</li> <li>Sparrow</li> </ul>"},{"location":"armor/#terran-republic","title":"Terran Republic","text":"<ul> <li>Pounder</li> <li>Dual-Cycler (\"DC\")</li> <li>Burster</li> </ul>"},{"location":"armor/#vanu-sovereignty","title":"Vanu Sovereignty","text":"<ul> <li>Comet</li> <li>Quasar</li> <li>Starfire</li> </ul>"},{"location":"armor/Agile_Exo-Suit/","title":"Agile Exo-Suit","text":"<p> Agile Exo-Suit at, from left to right, Battle Rank 1, 7, 14 and 25</p> <p> Agile Exo-Suit at, from left to right, Battle Rank 1, 7, 14 and 25</p> <p> Agile Exo-Suit at, from left the right, Battle Rank 1, 7, 14 and 25</p> <p>, Medical Applicator, BANK, REK, and CUD</p> Certification Required None Empire Common Pool Armor 100 Pistol Holsters 2 Rifle Holsters 1 Inventory Dimensions 9 x 9 <p>Agile Exo-Suit</p> <p>With about twice the protection of the Standard Exo-Suit and the flexibility of a second pistol slot and larger inventory, the Agile Exo-Suit is a vast improvement.

It can be returned to working order again by repairing it to 50% of its health using a Nano Dispenser. The Phalanx will be automatically repaired, albeit very slowly, as long as the base has a supply of NTUs.

The Anti-Aircraft Flak Cannon rounds are similar to the flak rounds of the skyguard, but fires at a slightly slower rate.

Interlink Facility</p> <p>Modules are devices that can be obtained from the Module Buildings in the Caverns introduced by the expansion Core Combat.</p> <p>When installed inside a surface base facility, modules grant the facility and the controlling empire a module benefit (apart from Facility Linked Benefits), depending on the type of module installed.</p> <p>In order to obtain a module, one must go to the caverns, capture a Module Building, obtain a non-powered module, and take it to the Core Complex to be charged. Once the module is removed from the Module Building, the player has fifteen minutes to charge the module and bring it to the surface. Once on the surface, the player has an additional fifteen minutes to install the module into a friendly base. Once the module is placed in a Module Cradle, all bases linked to the module will receive the benefits.</p> <p>Each Empire has a limit of 10 Modules that they can have installed at any given time. If exceeded, the only way to gain more modules is to steal them from enemy bases that have them. Also, only three modules can be in-transit in a cave at the same time. More modules cannot be taken from their cradles until at least one is taken to the surface or the timer expires on one. Taking a non-charged module to the surface causes the module to disappear. If a charged Module is still in the cave when an enemy empire captures the Module Building it was taken from, the module will explode instantly, regardless of the timer.</p> <p>Note: when carrying a module, your character will \"flash\" the color of the module you picked up. Also, similar to the LLU, an icon will appear on the map giving the location of you and the module for both friendlies and enemies to see, thus it's best to have an escort to avoid an enemy from stealing the module. A module icon flashing green means a friendly has picked it up. A red flashing icon means an enemy has it, and a black flashing icon means the module is on the ground. If the fifteen minute timer expires on the module, it will start beeping a different sound and explode after a random delay between 1 second and 5 minutes, killing the carrier and anything nearby.</p>"},{"location":"modules/#available-modules","title":"Available Modules","text":"<p>Currently, six types of modules are available to be installed (map icon color is listed):</p> <ul> <li>Equipment Module (blue)</li> <li>Health Module (yellow)</li> <li>Pain Module (beige)</li> <li>Shield Module (aqua)</li> <li>Speed Module (orange)</li> <li>Vehicle Module (purple)</li> </ul> <p>Empires may also try to achieve a Cavern Lock which will provide all six module benefits to any linked or chain linked facility as if they had a module installed.</p>"},{"location":"modules/#special-rules","title":"Special Rules","text":"<p>The modules are unique constructs, and are subject to several special rules, in the same vein as LLUs.</p> <ol> <li>Once installed in a facility, they cannot be removed by friendlies under    normal circumstances.

They managed to steal blueprints from the Terran Republic. We don't know how the TR were able to design it, but it looks as if they are developing a method to cloak a flying transport vehicle. With the amount of energy required to keep a craft airborne, we thought it physically impossible to bend light enough to cloak it as well, but with these designs...it might work. The TR are calling it the \"Phantasm\".</p> <p>Also among these blueprints is another design...it looks similar to the Galaxy, and yet somehow different. It's more like a giant battleship than a transport craft. In the hands of the TR, this kind of firepower could be devastating. I do not doubt that the VS spies have also taken advantage of the recent leak in TR security; they probably have the designs as well. We must begin training our soldiers to use this equipment as soon as possible. Our engineers have already started production...we must finish before the opposing factions are able to use them against us.</p> <p>The strangest thing about all of this is the fact that these blueprints were in TR possession. I would expect something like this from the Vanu Sovereignty, but the Terran Republic are narrow-minded fools that only think of suppression using our current technology. Also strange are these symbols found all over the blueprints; they are like nothing I've ever seen before. Shaped like 3 curved blades around a central hub with cyan coloring...what could it mean...\"</p> <p>Taken from a Vanu Sovereignty science report, only one day later:</p> <p>\"...don't understand. The entire lattice has shifted. Our home worlds, Esamir and Amerish, are gone, lost to the heathens that call themselves the New Conglomerate. And we find our own sanctuary linked to the homelands of our Terran repressors, Forseral and Ceryshen. We can only logically assume they have taken control of the former NC territories Solsar and Hossin.</p> <p>This change in the lattice can sometimes be observed as a natural phenomenon of Auraxis. The Auraxian system clearly has a mind of its own and has been known to shift before, but somehow...it is different this time. The readings are not the same. Information from our stellar cartography department shows that this time there has been some form of external tampering with the lattice!</p> <p>We believed ourselves to be the most technologically advanced of the three factions, but after we were given the documents for these new flying aircraft...we must concede that there may be a faction with an even greater understanding than ours...but the Terran Republic? It is hard to believe. We have ruled out that they are capable of such a change, so it must be something else. Could this be related to the symbols on the blueprints? More research needs to be done.</p> <p>Regardless, the fact remains that we now stand on unfamiliar ground. We can be reasonably sure that this is not the end of these strange occurrences. Something is coming. I can feel it...\"</p> <p>The Terran Republic technical reports are stating that the Phantasm and Gunship certifications can be purchased at local certification terminals however both vehicles are currently being manufactured and there it\u2019s been found that some of the supply has gone unaccounted for.

When enough experience is accumulated, the character will increase in Battle Rank.</p> <p>There are four principle ways to earn Battle Experience Points:</p> <p>Kills: Killing enemies earns experience, based on how long they have been alive (longer equals more BEP, although there is a cap) and what sort of armor/vehicles they are using (bigger equals more BEP). A trooper fresh out of the respawn tube who hasn't had time to equip anything is worth 1 BEP, whereas a Gunner Variant BFR who has been active for an hour or more can be worth at least 2500 BEP. This BEP is awarded to the soldier who got the kill shot, regardless of how much damage he or she may have done prior to the kill. Members of the killing soldier's squad who are in the same Zone also receive a percentage of the BEP awarded for the kill, modified by their proximity to the Experience waypoint. Kills made by a gunner in a vehicle you are driving will also earn you experience (driver and all gunners share the experience, but not passengers), whether you are in a Squad together or not.</p> <p>Facility Captures: The formula used to calculate this amount is complex, and is based on how many unique enemies and squadmates were within the SOI during the ten minutes prior to and during the hack itself and for how long. This figure caps at 2250 BEP per capture.</p> <p>Training: Experimenting with new things earns experience. Usually only relevant to very new soldiers, any object with a hovering gold/yellow exclamation mark logo above it will generate a pop-up window explanation and some BEP upon closer inspection. This rarely goes over 200 BEP a time, but can be helpful at early stages. These pop-ups are awarded for many things, including visiting a continent for the first time, using a looted gun for the first time, discovering Monoliths and so on, but are only ever awarded once. (See the Character Info 'Training' tab to keep track of these.)</p> <p>ANT Runs: A soldier successfully refueling a facility using an Advanced Nanite Transport (or BFR NTU Siphon) earns experience. The experience gained varies depending how much NTU the base requires to reach 100% capacity, and is rationed out to the ANT owner in 20 BEP ticks during refueling. Squad mates within the same zone also receive 20 BEP for each tick.

Suffice it to say that running Planetside windowed is generally a severe drag on your framerate, and there's absolutely no reason you should attempt it. If you have a top-of-the-line system, then you might be able to squeeze by, but in that case, what are you reading this for? Screen Resolution : Higher resolution means more pixels on the screen, and that means your graphics card has to draw more pixels every frame, which slows it down. If you want better framerates, decrease this, though there's no reason to go below 1024x768, and if you do, the HUD will be cramping your display to the extreme. Gamma Brightness and Gamma Contrast : These are monitor hardware settings and have nothing to do with framerates. Usually you won't ever touch them, but if the screen looks too dark or washed-out while you're playing, try sliding these around. Note that if Planetside CTDs while you're playing with an other-than-normal gamma setting, your desktop will keep that setting, and you'll probably have to restart your computer or dig into your graphics card settings to get rid of it. Not fun. Video Quality : Just a way to select from some pre-set video options. You can completely ignore this, it's better to do all the tweaking yourself to get a nice balance between good looks and good framerates. Viewing Distance : Affects how far you can see. As you decrease this, you'll see the view-distance \"fog\" rolling in to decrease your vision range. Less things that you can see means less things the graphics card has to draw, and better framerates. Don't worry, though; if you have everything else set way down low, you can crank this up to maximum with hardly any impact on your FPS. Besides, you don't want other people to be able to see farther than you can, do you? Video Bit-Depth : Affects how many colors are available to Planetside for drawing, well, everything. If you decrease this to 16-bit, your FPS will nearly double, but be warned, it makes the game look like total crap and nearly always causes catastrophic shearing. Do this only if you've tried everything else and your framerates are still unbearable, and I do mean unbearable. Texture Quality : Affects how blurry objects in the game look. The lower you go, the less sharply-defined they get, but the higher your framerates go. Increasing this setting by one step is roughly equivalent to doubling the amount of RAM Planetside needs to keep running, so use with caution. Setting this to \"Low\" can be a big framerate booster, and unlike changing to 16-bit color, things don't look too bad unless you get up close and personal. If High just isn't good enough for you, and you're running the Cray supercomputer, you can take this to the next level of detail under Advanced. Particle Effects : Particles come in all sorts of guises, but one mark of their appearance is that they usually don't last for very long. You can find particles in puffs of vehicle exhaust, explosions of any kind, orbital strikes, and more. This option sets the detail level of the particles and affects how cool things that involve particles look, as well as how many of them are created. If you set this to Low, you might not even see some particle effects at all. It doesn't make that much of a difference, but it can indeed impact your framerate if there's a ton of battle activity in the area.</p> <ul> <li>Addition by Raidin - Another thing worth mentioning is that when you raise   this to High, it turns on dynamic lighting for muzzle flashes on most, if not   all weapons. Dynamic lighting does take its toll on FPS, and can slow you down   to a crawl on an average video card if you have several people firing their   weapons on-screen at once. Try all 3 settings with some friends to find your   favorite.</li> </ul> <p>Flora Density : Affects how much planty stuff appears on the ground around you, thus enhancing the realism. Thank goodness this can be turned off, because even on Low, it sucks FPS like mad. The reason is that it uses a ton of alpha transparency, which takes your video card a while to compute and slows it down. Turn it Off for best performance. Mesh Detail (by Raidin) : This increases the polygon count on player and weapon models. They look better up-close but your video card has to render those extra polys. From my experience, the FPS decrease is negligible. The increase in graphic quality, however, is worth it, IMO. Experiment for yourselves.</p> <ul> <li>Addition by Sokko: I must admit he's right. Since it hardly ever impacts   your framerate, the increase in detail when you're looking at something close   to you is well worth it. Without this turned on, weapons especially look far   too blocky for you to even recognize. Turn it on unless you're working with   a 386.</li> </ul> <p>Draw Detail Web : Turning this on will make a large area of the terrain around you (the part you're usually concerned about) appear more detailed, though far-off terrain remains the same. Though it certainly looks pretty, it really does a number on your framerate, dropping it by 20 or more in some cases. Best to leave it off. Warpgate Effect : The weird little effect that shows when an object moves through (or stops at, in the case of shots) a warpgate bubble. So far as I can tell, it doesn't make a significant difference where framerate is concerned. Oddly enough, you must have Bullet Holes turned on in order for this to work. Bullet Holes : If you turn this on, bullet-based weapons will leave holes in the walls. Drawing all those extra decals does impact framerate, but not as much as you'd think. Like the above, it's a matter of whether you want those few extra FPS or not, and remember that you have to turn this on for the Warpgate Effect to show up.</p> <ul> <li>Note: When a large weapon impacts   One-Manned Field Turrets, it leaves a   black \"burn\" mark. Over time, these build up into a black sheet, which can   block the vision of the gunner in certain directions. If you gun field turrets   often, it's best to keep this option off.</li> </ul> <p>Shadows On/Off : If turned on, people and vehicles will cast shadows on the ground. It's a bit more of a significant impact on framerate than the Bullet Holes, and it's not really that much of a visual difference. Off is recommended. Weather Particles : Different from regular particles, weather particles are what appear when a weather front moves into town, like that ever actually happens (c'mon, devs, you can do better than that!). Thunderstorms, snowstorms, dust storms, all are composed of weather particles. None of these have a really significant impact on framerate at all. Leaving it off does not create a tactical advantage, since even if you can't see the weather particles, it's the view distance fog moving in that matters.</p> <ul> <li>Note by Marutuk: Apparently you now need to have the Skydome turned on for   this option to work.</li> </ul> <p>Skydome : This draws a whole bunch of eye candy up in the sky, which affects your framerate so randomly it's best to experiment with it for yourself. As stated above, you must have this turned on for Weather Particles to appear.</p>"},{"location":"terminology/Menu/#advanced-options","title":"Advanced Options","text":"<p>Texture Quality (32 bit) : Click this on, and get ready for a whole world of hurt in the graphics card department. Checking it is like selecting \"Super High\" in the Texture Quality on the previous tab. If you do, you can select which textures this should apply to by checking the big group of boxes in the lower half of this tab. Trust me, never check this box unless you've got the Batcomputer sitting on your desktop. Vertical Sync : Simply put, it makes the game easier on the eyes. If the graphics seem \"flickery\" to you or your eyes start to ache after a while playing, turn this on, but be warned that it does negatively impact your framerate. Also, sometimes your graphics card will already have VSync turned on by itself, so checking this will make no difference. Use triple buffer : Does what it says on the tooltip: It makes the game run smoother, but it uses a bit more RAM to do so. Checking this box will speed up your framerate and eliminate lots of freezing if you have enough RAM, but can negatively affect it if you don't. Fiddle around with it to find the best setting, and don't forget to try out a full-fledged battle or two while you're testing. Cull Animations : If this box is checked, the game will make player animations more jerky if your framerate is starting to suffer from a lot of activity in the area, thus making things easier on your graphics card. A lot of people just can't stand those jerky animations, so they turn this off. It does make a difference, but the actual amount of difference varies wildly. Select the mode for preloading textures : Shouldn't be touched under normal circumstances. As the text says, \"All\" will let Planetside take care of things for you, and is generally the best way to do things performance-wise. If you're really desperate, you can try setting this to other things, but don't expect a miracle. Reserved Texture : Defines a chunk of RAM that's used to store textures for quick copying to the VRAM on your graphics card, so they don't have to be loaded from the hard disk. Making it larger will get you smoother framerates (especially if you've increased the Texture Quality), but it might also slow things down because the game has less RAM to store other things in. Leaving it at the lowest setting is not recommended unless you have 512MB or less of RAM, so experiment to find out the highest it can safely go without impacting performance. Note that this should be the LAST bit of experimenting you do, after you finish setting all the other options. One perk of this option is that you don't have to restart PS for it to take effect; loading another continent and just playing for a bit is sufficient for it to fully kick in. Use detailed vehicles : Turning this off will make vehicles slightly less detailed and give them a different paint job. This doesn't make much of a difference FPS-wise unless there are a lot of vehicles in the area, and it has been known to cause graphical glitches (like detached thruster pods), so you should probably leave it on unless you REALLY like the alternate color scheme (ugh).</p>"},{"location":"terminology/Menu/#keymappings","title":"Keymappings","text":""},{"location":"terminology/Menu/#keyboard-settings","title":"Keyboard Settings","text":""},{"location":"terminology/Menu/#mouse-settings","title":"Mouse Settings","text":""},{"location":"terminology/Menu/#joystick-settings","title":"Joystick Settings","text":""},{"location":"terminology/Menu/#game-options","title":"Game Options","text":"<p>Always Run : Self explanatory, if checked your character will always run, if not you will walk.

The release rate of the bombs is also somewhat slower, as it the fall speed. Vultures can also release bombs at a slightly lower altitude than the Liberator. Their combination of superior speed and maneuverability with the limitations of bomb payload make the Vulture best suited to low level close support bombing.</p> <p>The tailgun of the Vulture also differs from the Liberator.

However if you have at least the Two Year Term of Service Award, you can acquire the Scorpion without certing Elite Assault.</p> <p>The Scorpion is a straight-trajectory \"smart missile\" that detonates at a range you lock in. While this primary explosion causes little damage, it launches 5 smaller rockets in a 90 degree spread downwards. These smaller rockets detonate after traveling approximately 25 meters, causing massive damage. If three of these rockets detonate in close proximity to an infantry unit, the unit will be killed. However, if either the primary round or secondary rockets hit anything before they reach their explosion distance, they fall to the ground and do not explode or do damage.</p> <p>To fire the Scorpion, you need to zoom in onto a target, then lock on to the selected target with your secondary fire key. This locks the weapon to detonate at that range (you can lock onto anything: a soldier, the ground, a wall, etc). You can then fire in any direction with the primary fire key.

It cannot fire at targets over 301.7 meters away either.</p> <p>The secondary rockets have a predictable explosion pattern: two rocklets will always be propelled at a 90 degree angle downwards from the primary explosion. The remaining 3 rocklets explode at random angles.

This allows for quicker kills, but the cone of fire jumps dramatically in this mode.</p>"},{"location":"weapons/Weapon/#radiator","title":"Radiator","text":"<p>The Radiator is an Ancient Technology grenade launcher which fires grenades that explode into a very large pain field. This field slowly damages enemies, completely ignoring their armor, and eats away at their health. Thisincludes enemies inside of a vehicle, which allows a coordinated radiator team to kill all drivers and passengers inside of a vehicle without touching the vehicle at all, which makes it ripe for hacking. However, the radiator generally does damage too slowly for this to be useful. The Radiator has two firing modes similar to the Thumper: explode on contact and time-fuse grenades.</p>"},{"location":"weapons/Weapon/#hand-held-grenades","title":"Hand Held Grenades","text":"<p>These are hand held versions of the Jammer grenade, Fragmentation grenade, and Plasma grenade grenades which are also used in the Thumper and the Punisher. These take up a pistol slot, but are actually stored in the inventory slightly smaller than normal pistol weapons. These can be incredibly useful, as they can hit enemies around cover and make them weaker, and lure them out into attacking you in their weakened state.</p>"},{"location":"weapons/Weapon/#general-use","title":"General Use","text":"<p>The weapons in PlanetSide are not extraordinarily difficult to utilize. To fire a weapon, use the fire button (default: Mouse 1). Some weapons have more than one fire mode, which can be switched to on the fly (default: mouse 2). If you are carrying more than one type of ammunition for the same gun, you can switch them with a slight delay (default: x). It is impossible to learn how to effectively use weapons through words, but there are general tips that can be learned.</p>"},{"location":"weapons/Weapon/#close-quarters-combat","title":"Close Quarters Combat","text":"<p>At ranges of less than 10 meters, generally, a Heavy Assault weapon is the best choice. Close Quarters Combat tends to involve running at full speed while firing, and not worrying about cone of fire. Strafing is important for dodging enemy fire, and constantly keeping your reticle on the enemy is incredibly important as well.</p>"},{"location":"weapons/Weapon/#long-range-combat","title":"Long Range Combat","text":"<p>In long range combat, cone of fire management becomes incredibly important. Generally speaking, fully automatic fire is never recommended for long range combat, as the cone of fire blooms far too much to be useful. Also, at these long ranges, it is important to remember that gravity does play a slight effect, and it effects the slower bullets more. You may have to compensate for this.</p>"},{"location":"weapons/Weapon/#see-also","title":"See Also","text":"<ul> <li>Weapons Index</li> <li>Weaponry Merit Commendations</li> </ul>"}]}
