**Thunderer**

Bolstering the New Conglomerate's hard-hitting arsenal, the Thunderer variant is
equipped with dual Gauss Cannons. These cannons are straight line-of-fire and
have very limited explosion radius. The Gauss Cannon's small, concentrated blast
makes even a near-miss heavily damaging to infantry. Like the Deliverer, the
Thunderer has adequate trunk space and can cross calm rivers and waterways by
floating at the surface.

**Introduced: May 27, 2004 with update version [2.7.6](../patches/2.7.6.md).**
