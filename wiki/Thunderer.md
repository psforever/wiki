**Thunderer**

Bolstering the New Conglomerate's hard-hitting arsenal, the Thunderer
variant is equipped with dual Gauss Cannons. These cannons are straight
line-of-fire and have very limited explosion radius. The Gauss Cannon's
small, concentrated blast makes even a near-miss heavily damaging to
infantry. Like the Deliverer, the Thunderer has adequate trunk space and
can cross calm rivers and waterways by floating at the surface.

**Introduced: May 27, 2004 with update version
[2.7.6](2.md.7.6).**
